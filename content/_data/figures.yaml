    alt: "A news report by Digitized Information Inc, exhibiting the heated plasma solution Japanese firm Aerial Burton has proposed for the creation of volumetric holograms. The video shows a small group of about 25 people standing on a residential street in Japan, watching as pinpricks of light levitate in the air in front of them. Upon closer inspection the lights form the outlines of shapes, including a butterfly and an arrow pointing down towards the ground."

    alt: "A black and white artistic rendering of the Pepper's Ghost Effect, drawn in the style of an etching. A theater audience, seated to the right of the frame watches an actor on the stage. Beneath the stage a projectionist shines a bright light on a second actor, who is dressed as a ghost. Both are out of sight of the audience. There is a sheer film suspended between the stage and the audience, which is capturing the reflection of the actor dressed as a ghost beneath the stage. Because of the viewing angle, it appears to the theater audience that this reflection stands onstage with the visible actor, creating a ghost."

    alt: "A promotional video by HOLOCO showing a natural history exhibit at the Middle Elbe Biosphere Reserve in Oranienbaum-Wörlitz, Germany. The exhibit case has a dead log inside of it, with a transparent screen at an angle in front of it. Utilizing a Pepper's Ghost Effect, the transparent screen catches the reflection of a television screen below it, making it appear to the viewer that the birds on the screen are appearing on the log in the exhibit case. The display cycles through the organisms which use the log as a home throughout the course of a day and night, including birds, bugs, and fungi."
