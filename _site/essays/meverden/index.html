                  Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere. With the
                  creation of <em>Siri</em>, <em>Alexa</em>, and other virtual
                  command search engines, we can engage with information in a
                  more interactive and interpersonal way. An extension of this
                  development is generative artificial intelligence, or
                  generative AI, which the World Economic Forum defines as
                  “artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning
                  algorithms to create new content in the form of images, text,
                  audio, and more” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Routley 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Routley, Nick. “What is Generative AI? An AI explains.”

                  as an umbrella term for all machine learning platforms that

                  Whether with humorous user intention or not, generative AI has
                  the potential to change how online users engage with people,
                  learn new trends, and transform how we think about our
                  routines and the world around us. Specifically, ChatGPT is
                  beginning to transform the education sector, as teachers and
                  professors are working to adapt to using (or prohibiting the
                  use of) ChatGPT in their classrooms. As ChatGPT and other
                  forms of generative AI become popular discussion topics within
                  the legal and educational sectors, it has also become
                  increasingly provocative within the museum sector. With these
                  technological developments, a new question for studying and
                  interpreting history is apparent: What if we used generative
                  AI to transport us into the past? Within this think piece, I
                  will explore the agency of historical figures in current
                  museum exhibitions and inquire how museums take precautions
                  with using AI.

                  The question of authenticity and technology collaborating
                  within a museum space predates the invention of generative AI.
                  Specifically, conversations around “deep fakes” in museums
                  have been around since at least the mid-2010s. For instance,
                  scholars Jenny Kidd and Arran J. Rees write about AI within
                  the greater humanities field, ranging from 3D prints of
                  Rembrandt artworks to the generative artwork Portrait of
                  Edmond Belamy selling for $432,500 in 2018 (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Kidd 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Kidd, Jenny, and Arran J.

                  a negative connotation. Some journalists have argued that AI
                  perpetuates “fake news” and misinformation, especially when
                  addressing AI-generated videos of using someone’s likeness to

                  Generative AI has a controversial use case in nearly every
                  industry, including the museum sector. While there has been
                  discourse around chatbots in museums within the past decade,
                  AI platforms like ChatGPT are a novelty in the museum sector,
                  leaving much to be discovered. In some areas, ChatGPT excels,
                  having passed national exams–including the US Medical

                  accurately cite sources and its inability to perform simple
                  mathematical problems (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Merritt 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Merritt, Elizabeth. “Chatting About Museums with

                  generating text, many workers in writing-based careers are
                  worried that the AI platform will replace them. Moreover,
                  ChatGPT and other AI platforms have a track record of
                  perpetuating racism and bias. In 2018, several users of

                  Can and should AI learning be used in this way if more
                  research is needed on how the appliance retrieves information?
                  What about other history-based AI apps? Can the same hold true
                  for future trials of the same concept? I tested out another
                  education-based app called “<a href="https://www.hellohistory.ai/for-education" target="_blank">Hello History</a>,” developed by another company called Humy (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">For Education 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“For Education.” Hello History - Chat with AI Generated

                  it is owned by a parent company that designs personalized AI
                  assistants for smart device users. When I went to open the
                  app, I looked to see who I could speak to. With nearly 400
                  historical figures to have conversations with, I did not find
                  an AI version of Hitler, Pol Pot, or any notorious dictator. I
                  decided to ask AI Anne Frank a few questions. Similar to
                  Historical Figures Chat, Hello History warned me that the
                  generated chat responses were “based on online historical
                  information” and that “the responses may have biases and

                  I asked AI Anne Frank four questions. Each response I received
                  was very academic and reflective in tone. For instance, when I
                  asked AI Anne about her legacy, she responded the following
                  about her famed diary: “Though initially written as a personal
                  outlet during our period of hiding, it has become a symbol of
                  resilience and hope in the face of adversity.”

                  I then asked former Soviet ruler Vladimir Lenin the same
                  question: “What is your legacy?” In his response, he stated
                  that his legacy “lies in the revolutionary zeal with which I
                  dedicated myself to advancing the cause of the proletariat.”
                  When I asked about his views on the demise of the Russian

                  “[I]t remains a matter of debate as to what extent I

                  Using AI platforms can provide a growth opportunity for
                  museums, whether it be generating ideas for how to organize an
                  exhibition or aiding in digital preservation. However, it is
                  important to note that this product is only valuable when a
                  human uses it. As Merritt poses the question of whether or not
                  museum staff should use ChatGPT as a writing and research
                  tool, she also asserts that human staff would need to be
                  present to do fact-checking and assess the platform’s
                  language. This shows that an AI platform cannot completely
                  replace a human being’s work. Major institutions
                  <a href="https://datascience.si.edu/ai-values-statement" target="_blank">like the Smithsonian</a>
                  have incorporated values statements regarding their use of AI.
                  While the Smithsonian embraces using AI tools to aid in the
                  digitization and discoverability of historic materials and
                  source communities online, the institution asserts it will
                  only use technologies that respect its public and represent
                  the values of its institution (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">AI Values Statement 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“AI Values Statement.” AI Values Statement | Smithsonian

                  What are some ways that museums can use AI to represent
                  history in their exhibitions? A possible answer can be
                  provided in the tailored use of generative AI in the Salvador
                  Dalí Museum and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
                  (USHMM). In 2019, for instance, the Salvador Dalí Museum
                  utilized DALL-E, “sibling” software to ChatGPT, to splice
                  photos, videos, and recordings of Dalí’s mannerisms and vocal
                  patterns to create a realistic likeness of the late surrealist
                  painter (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Dalí Museum 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Salvador Dalí Museum. “Dalí Lives (via Artificial

                  projection of Dalí would create another avenue for visitors to
                  explore Dalí’s creative mind and inspiration for his
                  celebrated artworks. At the end of the exhibit, the
                  AI-generated Dalí asks his visitors if they would like to take
                  a picture with him, and he takes a selfie using a smartphone
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Dalí Museum 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Salvador Dalí Museum. “Dalí Lives (via Artificial

                      <a href="https://thedali.org/exhibit/dali-lives/" target="_blank">https://thedali.org/exhibit/dali-lives/</a>.</span></cite>). In reality, Salvador Dalí would not have known what a
                  smartphone was in his lifetime–let alone know how to take a
                  selfie with one–as he passed away in the late 1980s.
                  Therefore, is it wrong for the museum to share this minute
                  inaccuracy about Dalí’s life? What other ramifications can
                  historical AI figures bring?

                  Regarding the Dalí Museum, I was drawn to Hank Hine’s
                  (Executive Director) emphasis on using AI Salvador Dalí to add
                  another layer of empathy to the exhibit (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Dalí Museum 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Salvador Dalí Museum. “Dalí Lives (via Artificial

                      <a href="https://thedali.org/exhibit/dali-lives/" target="_blank">https://thedali.org/exhibit/dali-lives/</a>.</span></cite>). In using Dalí’s mannerisms and stories of his life through
                  the exhibit of his famous works, I can see how visitors would
                  have a more nuanced understanding of Dalí’s creative vision.
                  The desire for empathic reasoning and a dedicated mission to
                  crafting accurate portrayals of a historical figure’s identity
                  is commendable and should be the expectation within a museum
                  setting. It is evident to me that the Dalí Museum has curated
                  a version of Salvador Dalí that honors his artistic views and
                  offers insightful commentary on his artwork.

Through this initiative, visitors can ask and actively
                  converse with survivors about their lives before, during, and
                  after the Holocaust. The answers are pre-recorded from living
                  survivors, and docents are around to help visitors craft their
                  questions. While this initiative brings an interpersonal layer
                  to the exhibit, it also raises questions about the spectator
                  being the main focus rather than the survivor’s experience.

                  While the USC Shoah Foundation and USHMM’s collaboration was
                  very well received by scholars, journalists, and general
                  museum-goers, the team was concerned about the project
                  unintentionally making a spectacle out of this grave tragedy.
                  However, as Stephen Smith (Executive Director of the USC Shoah
                  Foundation) shared, the first group to participate in the
                  project without question were the survivors themselves.
                  Survivors gave their time and consent to answer over 2,000
                  questions, and for that, their memory will transcend their
                  lifetimes and will be accessed by generations.

                  Both of the above exhibitions, while having their concerns,
                  have a narrowly tailored focus on what hologram-like
                  depictions can express in an exhibit that is reviewed by
                  museum staff and third-party partners. Museums also have a
                  plethora of resources–from digital catalogs to informational
                  videos–which fosters a dynamic learning environment. As the
                  Smithsonian’s AI Values Statement shares, it is imperative
                  that the museum documents how its AI content is produced and
                  for what purpose it serves (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">AI Values Statement 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“AI Values Statement.” AI Values Statement | Smithsonian

                  how the bias aids the museum in its programming. Some central
                  messages from the AI Values Statement are the need for
                  continuous supervision of AI tools and clear distinction of
                  when AI is used, for what reason, and where exactly it draws
                  its data from (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">AI Values Statement 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“AI Values Statement.” AI Values Statement | Smithsonian

                  drew input from all corners of the Internet, including
                  divisive, discriminatory, and flamingly incorrect information,
                  with very little sign of oversight from the app’s AI team. As
                  Chadda previously shared, his product would be more successful
                  if it had better training. Therefore, museums should follow
                  the AI Values Statement in continuing to review the
                  information they are inputting in their AI-generated
                  initiatives and the legality of its use.

                <p>
                  Generative AI is a new phenomenon in the legal field,
                  especially concerning copyright law. Copyright law states that
                  someone can be the sole owner of their work for the time of
                  their lifetime plus 70 years after their death (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Frank 2015</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Frank, Will. “IP-rimer: A Basic Explanation of

In a museum setting, could family or descendants have
                  copyright over their ancestor’s image? According to the
                  National Library of Medicine, only if the ancestor (especially
                  if they were famous in their lifetime) has a current
                  foundation and license to use their likeness (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">National Library of Medicine 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">National Library of Medicine. “Copyright: Patron Guide to

                  Gogh, all of their works are in the public domain.

                  Additionally, intellectual property claims–or, claims that
                  focus on the legal protection of one’s ideas and creative
                  work–can be poorly received in some cases. For example, if
                  someone uses intellectual property law to censor someone’s
                  criticisms of their work, then the courts will often rule
                  against the plaintiff, or person who started the legal case
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Frank 2015</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Frank, Will. “IP-rimer: A Basic Explanation of

With this legal observation, could some courts dismiss
                  copyright claims to the portrayal of AI historical figures in
                  museum exhibitions?

                  According to a <em>Reuters</em> report in August 2023,
                  AI-generated art cannot be copyrighted, since it was not
                  directly made by a human artist (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Brittain 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Brittain, Blake. “AI-generated art cannot receive

With this knowledge in mind, would copyright laws impede a
                  museum’s ability to use AI projections in future exhibitions?
                  The United States Congress is assessing various arguments for
                  and against the use of AI across the country (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Zirpoli 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Zirpoli, Christopher T. “Generative Artificial

                  necessary to file for a copyright claim. Without human beings
                  to advocate for themselves, it appears that AI can be used to
                  reconfigure a historical person’s likeness.

                <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
                <p>
                  AI is not going anywhere. It is not only beginning to hold
                  influence in museums but the greater workforce and our legal
                  landscape. Earlier this month in November of 2023, the
                  SAG-AFTRA Union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and
                  Television Producers (AMPTP) reached an agreement that studios
                  must compensate and receive consent from the actor to allow
                  generative AI to replicate their likeness (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Klar 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Klar, Rebecca. “SAG-AFTRA releases agreement, details AI
                      protections.” <em>The Hill</em>. November 13, 2023.
                      Accessed November 26, 2023.

This case will likely help reinforce the precedent that
                  consent is needed to generate AI based on a living person;
                  however, the legality of using an AI replica of a deceased
                  person is not always quite as clear.
                </p>

                  AI is being explored as a tool for crafting an engaging
                  visitor experience. However, there are ethical considerations
                  that should be made when experimenting with AI. As code and
                  algorithms are made by humans, they come with complexities
                  that require human literacy and understanding. Technology can
                  surprise machines and humans alike. As stated by museum
                  experts Ariana French and Elena Villaespesa, the sector should
                  establish clear expectations for how AI should be used in
                  their museums and allocate their resources accordingly (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">French and Villaespesa 2019</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">French, Ariana, and Elena Villaespesa. “AI, Visitor

                <p>
                  As the USHMM and the Dalí Museum illustrate, museums can use
                  AI effectively if they can strategically tailor their
                  programming to a specific language that holds the integrity of
                  the history they are representing. In utilizing a cautious
                  approach and scheduling frequent training sessions by staff
                  and third-party vendors, AI can be used as a useful
                  educational tool within the museum sector. However, with any
                  new invention, it is essential the museum uses it often and
                  with great review. When used with ethical consideration, AI
                  can be a promising feature for new exhibitions. Museums should
                  continue to use generative AI with great caution.
