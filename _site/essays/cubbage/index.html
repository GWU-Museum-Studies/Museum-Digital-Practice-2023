                  Thanks to new technology and post-pandemic culture shifts in
                  the way we engage with spaces in person and online, the demand
                  for recreation of physical spaces on digital platforms for
                  education and recreation has never been higher. Advances in
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry" target="_blank">photogrammetry</a>
                  technology and VR integration have created new possibilities
                  for taking real objects and environments and recreating them
                  in explorable digital spaces. Potentially a result of the
                  COVID-19 pandemic, there is a strong desire for people to
                  experience meaningful places, which is evident in the travel
                  industry’s rebound as pandemic regulations lessened. People
                  desire to return to spaces that bring comfort and meaning, as
                  well as to experience things they could not during periods of
                  closure. Those who can’t travel find other ways to engage with
                  places they are nostalgic for, including through online
                  communities or through materials produced by museums and
                  historic sites. Audiences look for interesting ways to
                  experience meaningfully designed spaces as they remember them
                  through online formats, including through increasingly popular
                  theme park attraction ride-through videos,
                  <a href="https://www.negative-g.com/no-limits/No%20Limits%20Defunct%20Coasters.htm" target="_blank">virtual reality coaster ride simulators</a>, and a wide range of virtual tours of museum exhibits and
                  cultural heritage.

                  An exploration of nostalgia and how it pertains to preserving
                  designed space inspired the following look at museums and
                  virtual reality. While considering the benefits of digitizing
                  existing exhibits for VR, I looked at the very active online
                  fan communities that exist around theme parks. Despite their
                  dedication being focused on for-profit parks and resorts,
                  theme park fans go to great lengths to record, document, and
                  digitize the histories of theme parks and attractions that
                  currently stand or that have long since been demolished or
                  modified. Rich, crowdsourced histories exist of Walt Disney
                  World rides from development to demolition. Extensive,
                  multi-POV ride through videos exist of attractions at parks
                  all around the world for those who may not have the chance to
                  visit them. Ambitious fans, such as those behind the
                  <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/8/22219427/disney-ride-20000-leagues-under-the-sea-watch-vr-defunctland" target="_blank">Defunctland VR Project</a>, have gone so far as to recreate entire ride experiences in
                  VR so that fans can experience lost attractions in full detail
                  once again. These projects are generated by themed
                  entertainment audience members who long to capture the work
                  that went into creating designed space and what it was like to
                  experience said attraction firsthand. These audiences aren’t
                  just a niche either—the
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVo63lbKHjC04KqYhwSZ_Pg" target="_blank">Defunctland YouTube channel</a>
                  regularly nets millions of views on their extensively
                  researched theme park history videos. Visitors feel a strong
                  sense of attachment to themed entertainment settings, often
                  strengthened by nostalgia for travel and for time spent with
                  family. I often see discussions online from fan communities
                  about theme parks, but rarely to the same degree about
                  museums.

                  While theme parks and museums might not immediately seem tied
                  closely together, they are both tourism destinations that are
                  designed to intentionally immerse visitors in an environment
                  where they are most receptive to the products or information
                  shared within them. The
                  <a href="https://www.teaconnect.org/" target="_blank">Themed Entertainment Association</a>
                  recognizes the close interconnectivity and shared audiences of
                  museums and theme parks for the tourism industry in the
                  experience economy. In both worlds, visitors’ complete
                  experiences are curated from entrance to exit to provide the
                  best possible visit. Both sectors strive to make the
                  experience of visiting memorable, unique, and distinct from
                  other places to foster a relationship with the guest. Exhibits
                  are designed to provide an environment that is complimentary
                  to the content—whether that is through immersive exhibits in
                  science museums or carefully curated spaces of reflection in
                  art museums. Museum objects do not exist out of place, the
                  space and presentation of how they are perceived are integral
                  to the creation of memory and the overall experience of the
                  visitor. Visitors will remember what’s meaningful because of
                  the wholistic experience, not just the objects themselves.

                  Theme park enthusiasts work hard to document park experiences
                  by sharing them while they are operational online for others
                  to see, or by painstakingly recreating demolished attractions
                  through photographs, video, and VR—largely because they know
                  the park ownership will not. Rebecca Williams’ work on fandom
                  culture around theme parks discusses that fan memorialization
                  of theme park attractions may help provide a method of
                  reassuring “ontological security” by allowing fans to
                  re-articulate and re-explore their attachments to rides and
                  exhibits and the associated memories tied to them. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Williams 2020, 213</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Williams, Rebecca.

                        participatory cultures</em>. Amsterdam University Press, 2020.</span></cite>) I believe that museum audiences are more like these theme
                  park enthusiasts than we typically discuss, but have a
                  different relationship of attachment to museums as sites to
                  preserve—the obligation to preserve museum spaces and their
                  history is not in the hands of fan-historians working against
                  corporate ownership but instead is a role for museums
                  themselves. Museums have a reputation of record keeping and
                  preservation, and there is an expectation of diligence in
                  documentation. When given ways to engage with museum exhibits
                  past and present online, I believe museum audiences similarly
                  re-explore their attachments in a way that fosters their
                  positive relationship with institutions. Virtual reality,
                  while primarily used for tours and outreach online for current
                  exhibits, allows museums to create records of their exhibits
                  that allow audiences to connect to their collections remotely
                  or after exhibits close. Maintaining the emotional connection
                  between visitors and exhibit spaces allows guests to explore
                  feelings of nostalgia and wonder linked to spatial memory,
                  helping encourage repeat visitorship, foster donor
                  relationships, and maintain positive feelings about the
                  institution.

                  Resources for creating Virtual Reality tours have become more
                  accessible, creating new possibilities for how exhibits are
                  documented and displayed online. Some museums, such as the
                  National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) are ahead of the
                  crowd with
                  <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/visit/virtual-tour" target="_blank">many virtual tours of exhibits past and present</a>
                  available on their website. Others have gone further and
                  created exhibit experiences in third party game software.
                  Still many other institutions have never considered creating
                  VR versions of their exhibits and would not know where to
                  begin. With the increasing pressure on museums to provide
                  online resources, I believe that utilizing VR to document
                  exhibits serves an important twofold function—it creates a
                  means by which audiences can engage with the museum from home
                  and it creates a record of the holistic experience of
                  exhibitions that can be used by museum fans and museum
                  academics when we discuss exhibit design.

                <h3>Virtual Reality and Preserved Museum Spaces</h3>
                <p>
                  The most widely used method of documenting real space in full
                  is using 360° cameras. Utilized in industries such as house
                  tours for real estate, mapping software, and in museums, 360°
                  cameras capture the panoramic details of a location through
                  photography. Typically done with omnidirectional cameras which
                  capture a picture in every direction at the same time,
                  panoramic images of spherical videos create a 3D effect
                  without being 3D. These pictures can be shared as 2D images
                  which can be navigated by scrolling or by following paths of
                  associated images that have been connected. Commonly used
                  services such as Google Photos and Facebook both have
                  integration for sharing these types of panoramic images. They
                  may also be captured for conversion for use in VR, which can
                  provide a more organic way for viewers to explore the space.

                  exhibits, although more expensive and therefore less often
                  utilized in smaller institutions.

                  The 2020 global pandemic acted as a catalyst for museums to
                  evaluate their digital footprint as the world adapted to
                  engaging with learning and culture through digital formats
                  during lock down and subsequent periods of high-risk
                  transmission. Museums who could not serve the public on-site
                  needed to find ways to engage their audiences through other
                  means, and more and more institutions took their first leap
                  into utilizing technology to provide some kind of supplemental
                  experience. While many museums opted to provide tours or
                  programs facilitated through video format over zoom or through
                  prerecorded tours, other museums with resources to do so chose
                  to innovate using XR technology (a catchall term for Virtual
                  Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality experiences).
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Gerencer 2021</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Gerencer, Tom. “What Is Extended Reality (XR) and How Is

                  provide additional interpretation to exhibits, sometimes
                  in-lieu of contact with educators. Other museums found ways to
                  present their collections of objects online, often in
                  blank-walled digital galleries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These digital galleries, albeit useful for the museum to share
                  their objects, may not integrate the thoughtful design of the
                  exhibitions that objects are presented within. While this may
                  work for certain types of collections such as art museums, it
                  fails to provide the immersion of experiencing an exhibit
                  in-context and does not create the nostalgic triggers
                  associated with seeing a work of art or exhibit in the context
                  of the museum space itself. This may lead to less association
                  between the viewer and the museum, as opposed to just the
                  object being presented. However, the blank-walled VR rooms
                  provide a fast way for museums to present art in explorable
                  space next to other associated works, likely saves work hours
                  and design costs to create, and do not require museums to
                  purchase cameras needed for fuller capture of the exhibit
                  environment.

                  space and content in our associated memory. Vortic’s platform
                  also provides institutions the ability to host meetings,

                  The VR format allows museums to preserve more than just the
                  spatial details of exhibits. As demonstrated thorough the Los
                  Angeles Museum of Art’s <em>Substrata</em>
                  <a href="https://epoch.gallery/substrata/" target="_blank">virtual exhibit hosted on the digital exhibition platform
                    EPOCH</a>, exhibits can integrate audio and ambiance into the
                  experience of viewing. Just as museums are not spaces void of
                  noise, music, and designed sound in person, digital exhibits
                  can also integrate audio into the experience. Not only does
                  this more closely mimic the experience a visitor might have
                  while viewing an exhibit and therefore more likely trigger
                  associated feelings of nostalgia, but it also offers a place
                  for the soundtracks designed for museum settings to continue
                  to live on past the exhibit’s in-person lifespan.
                  <em>Unsettled</em>, an exhibition created by the Australian
                  Museum, integrates audio that is key to the visitor experience
                  in-person into their
                  <a href="https://australian.museum/learn/first-nations/unsettled/" target="_blank">virtual tour</a>. In doing this, the virtual experience becomes closer to the
                  in-person experience and creates a space where the
                  compositions made for the exhibit continue to serve their
                  purpose.

                <h3>VR Museums in Game Spaces</h3>
                <p>
                  Recently, museums have begun to recognize the value of
                  partnering with video game companies to reach broader
                  audiences. Platforms such as Roblox, VR Chat, Second Life, and
                  Sansar provide existent platforms to host exhibits and
                  collaboration events within. This has certain benefits—these
                  platforms already have existing audiences that the museum can
                  draw from to expand viewership. They may already have
                  integrated creator tools and assets that make the process of
                  setting up the exhibit faster or more streamlined.
                  Partnerships with platforms benefit both parties and may help
                  cut costs of development or provide free advertising for the
                  partnering museum. However, it also has downsides. Although
                  true of most software that is not developed in-house, there is
                  no guarantee of the lifespan of the platform hosting the
                  virtual exhibit. Ownership of companies, hosting costs, and
                  collaborator interests all mean that there is no guarantee
                  that a digital exhibit created in these spaces will have
                  longevity. While innovative, game platforms can be a risky
                  place for museums to invest all their VR resources.

                  One example of this is the VR exhibit companion to the
                  Smithsonian American Art Museum’s (SAAM)

                  artworks on display, as well as the associated lighting design
                  and sound that complimented them. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Bonasio 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Bonasio, Alice. “Experience the Art of Burning Man in

                  and utilize a VR headset to access, which creates a smaller
                  audience pool than if hosted on the SAAM site.

                  the company behind both Second Life and Sansar, to recreate
                  the Peale and its exhibits on the platform. This undertaking
                  had twofold purposes—to allow visitors to continue to access
                  the Peale and its collections from home, as well as to allow
                  the staff and museum collaborators to meet in a setting that
                  allowed them to better activate their connection to the museum
                  while working remotely. This connectivity to the museum site
                  helped keep staff enthusiastic and connected to the collection
                  and helped them better understand their space so they could
                  develop projects even while away. The virtual Peale became
                  both a meeting space and an extension of Peale’s mission.

                  Hosting exhibits in game platforms allows virtual visitors
                  more expression, more movement, and often more detail.
                  However, the game element can also be a hindrance to the goal
                  of the content. Because it is hosted in Second Life, which
                  offers robust player avatar customization, the virtual Peale
                  is no stranger to player avatar attire not suitable for a
                  museum setting and had to create a dress code for the online
                  space. Similarly, player behavior can be unpredictable in any
                  type of game. Fortnite’s
                  <a href="https://theconversation.com/fortnites-new-in-game-holocaust-museum-shows-us-a-virtual-future-for-education-215500" target="_blank">virtual Holocaust Museum</a>
                  specifically has paired down game-play features and disabled
                  emotes to preserve the respectful tone of the exhibit
                  experience—a lesson that was learned from rowdy player
                  behavior at the virtual Martin Luther King experience hosted
                  before. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Gilliam 2021</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Gilliam, Ryan. “Fortnite’s MLK Event Is a Weird Way to

                  interacts with VR exhibits and how, and museums should
                  consider this when choosing the platform to develop for.

                <h3>Archiving Designed Space For Museum Scholars</h3>
                <p>
                  I believe there is value in documenting exhibit design for
                  educational and evaluative purposes for the museum field.
                  Operating with limited budgets, it’s understanding that
                  museums taking the effort to digitize exhibits for the sake of
                  the museum field can be seen as self-serving. But as a
                  graduate student, I have had many moments during research
                  where I desperately wished I could see exhibits that are no
                  longer standing to answer questions about how artifacts or
                  theming were presented in-context, how guests navigated spaces
                  and if they were accessible, or simply about how an exhibit on
                  a topic was handled by a museum. For academics who want to
                  innovate in the museum field, it feels remiss the
                  documentation of exhibits in-full is something that’s not more
                  widely done. Museum’s self-presented exhibit archives online
                  are often simple splash pages about what existed before--
                  occasionally, the more detailed include installation photos or
                  collection details. I am always thankful when a virtual tour
                  is available when researching museums, allowing me to compare
                  content even when I don’t have the privilege to see a site in
                  person.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A resource that made me consider the value documentation of
                  past exhibits is Zoolex. Created by the Zoo Design
                  Association,
                  <a href="https://zoolex.org/" target="_blank">Zoolex</a>
                  collects museum-submitted profiles about zoo and aquarium
                  habitats around the world. The database provides information
                  about zoo design, displays innovations in exhibit design
                  through photograph documentation and exhibit layout drawings,
                  and even provides climate data about the environmental
                  conditions of the habitat. Created as the result of Monika
                  Ebenhöh’s thesis “Improvements in Zoo Design by Internet-Based
                  Exchange of Expertise”, Zoolex acts as a resource for zoo
                  designers and caretakers. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ebenhöh 1992</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ebenhöh, Monika. “Improvements in Zoo Design by

                      University of Georgia, 1992.</span></cite>) I yearn for a similar multi-institutional database for
                  exhibit designers in the broader field. While Zoolex does not
                  provide fully digitized exhibit layouts, the photo
                  documentation alongside design information is an excellent for
                  visualizing space for those researching their exhibits. What
                  would a multi-institutional database for past exhibits look
                  like and could it be viable? That’s hard to say—the audience
                  could be niche, and like Zoolex, museums would need to opt
                  into summitting their own gallery tours or images. However, it
                  would be an amazing resource to have the ability to search
                  exhibitions up by topic to compare how they were handled at
                  institutions around the world and across time, allowing
                  designers to be inspired by what has come before, double check
                  their own work for accidental plagiarism from exhibits they
                  saw before but may have forgotten, and to compare how the same
                  topic might be exhibited to different audiences globally.

                  Some institutions like the National Museum of Natural History
                  have established digitization resources, such as the team they
                  dub the “Laser Cowboys”. The Laser Cowboys of the Smithsonian
                  Digitization Program Office’s 3D lab use laser scanners to
                  document exhibitions, such as the massive Fossil Hall before
                  it’s renovation in 2014. During that project, “cowboy” Adam
                  Metallo said: “The main purpose of 3D scanning an exhibit like
                  this is to have an archive of what an exhibit of this era
                  might have looked. This is a documentation for folks in the
                  future to know what a museum experience here was like.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Smithsonian Magazine 2013</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Smithsonian Magazine. “A Night at the Museum with the

                  objects for public access, but for documenting how the
                  exhibit’s design and context might be useful for designers and
                  academics in the future. While it can sometimes be hard to
                  justify the time and cost of digitization, the archival value
                  to the museum field is immense. It is my hope other museums
                  who have the resources to will also choose to document their
                  exhibits for this reason, especially ones that have such high
                  visitation or cultural impact such as NMNH.

                <h3>Barriers to Creating VR Exhibits</h3>
                <p>
                  While it would be amazing if every museum could digitize their
                  exhibits, the reality as discussed is that there are many
                  barriers to undertaking VR projects. While not every 3D
                  digitization project requires thousands of man-hours of work
                  to complete, they do all require some level of flexibility by
                  staff to take time, usually before or after operational hours,
                  to do the manual work of photographing or laser-scanning the
                  space. Most institutions do not have a team already trained in
                  photogrammetry technology, let alone in creating digital
                  programming, so time and financial resources are required to
                  train staff and purchase equipment or to hire external
                  contractors to complete the project. Even after the work of
                  scanning is completed, the institution then needs to host,
                  publish, or save the files for present or future use, which
                  requires the digital resources to do so. For institutions who
                  choose to partner with platforms like VR Chat or Second Life,
                  there must be staff available to manage the relationship with
                  the software and who can integrate the exhibit materials onto
                  the platform. These skills don’t come overnight, especially
                  for museums who have yet to adopt newer technologies. The
                  output of a virtual tour may require an entirely new staff
                  role (or more) just to get off the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Outside of just the startup costs involved in taking on VR
                  projects, the longevity of VR exhibits once published is also
                  uncertain. Unless a museum has a robust team dedicated to
                  digital projects already, they are likely relying on outside
                  parties when hosting and creating their VR exhibits. Whether
                  this is through services such as Google, Second Life, or
                  Matterport, there needs to be somewhere to put the digitized
                  exhibit so that visitors can interface with it. While
                  companies expect their continued lifespans, the retirement of
                  the widely used Adobe Flash highlights that something that is
                  expected to be lasting and easy to integrate onto a web
                  platform isn’t necessarily going to stick around. Virtual
                  exhibits created on third-party platforms have an uncertain
                  fate if companies like Matterport or Vortic close. Could the
                  museum reuse the scans on another platform, especially if they
                  used proprietary scanning techniques during the image
                  collection process? Are there ways for the museum to keep
                  versions of the tours that don’t require any specific
                  software? These are questions to consider when we think about
                  the fate of digital exhibits that exist now. The National
                  Museum of Natural History supports the future of their digital
                  exhibit tours by working with virtual reality artist Loren
                  Ybarrondo, who coded their virtual tours in HTML5 and
                  JavaScript for specific use by the institution, meaning no
                  additional software is required to host. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ybarrondo 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ybarrondo, Loren. “Loren Ybarrondo: Create Immersive

                  their VR projects, their budget allows for commissioned
                  coding. But other institutions may not have the same ownership
                  of their work and could grapple with hosting issues in the
                  future.

                  For smaller museums just trying to get a VR project off the
                  ground, uncertain hosting futures and usage rights can make
                  planning difficult. To help alleviate some of the resource
                  strain on museums starting up VR projects,
                  <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/egWRnanxkLB0zg" target="_blank">Google Arts &amp; Culture</a>
                  has initiatives and funding to provide different kinds of 3D
                  digitization services for free, and host VR tours of museums
                  and cultural sites on their platform. Partnering with Google
                  reduces the work on the museum teams themselves, but comes
                  with the complications of partnering with a massive company
                  that comes with its own corporate complications about access,
                  usage rights, user data, and funding that not every
                  institution is willing to sacrifice on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not every museum is likely to be sold on the pitch of 3D
                  digitization of exhibits. Some might value the temporal nature
                  of exhibitions and prefer to let them exist and then pass as
                  part of their process. Other museums may be protective of
                  their materials such as architectural details, lighting
                  design, or the artworks shown inside an exhibit. Some museums
                  may fear that a digital version of an exhibit will dissuade
                  in-person visitation. Artist’s usage rights might control the
                  digital use of their works, which may prevent inclusion in VR
                  exhibits. Anything from the unwillingness to use budget
                  resources to a distrust of digital platforms could act as a
                  barrier. For those who have already undertaken VR exhibit
                  efforts, there is also the possibility of discouragement – a
                  first VR exhibit experience might have been costly and time
                  consuming while learning the ropes, which may put teams off
                  from continuing to digitize more. Teams must grapple with
                  where to invest resources if VR exhibits aren’t getting the
                  outreach draw that were expected, even if the end product is
                  impressive and archivally useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The pitch to executives and donors to invest resources in
                  digitization can be difficult. Even the purest academic value
                  of preservation of exhibits for the museum field is unlikely
                  to be enough to sell VR exhibits to those who don’t see the
                  immediate value. But as discussed when considering audience
                  nostalgia of exhibits and attractions, there are ways to
                  articulate the value of digitized spaces that serve many
                  museum’s goals of legacy, audience retention, and outreach.
                  Pushing past the novelty of the medium can be difficult, but a
                  thoughtful argument can express how preserving exhibit spaces
                  benefit museum audiences past, present, and future. Museums
                  audiences are fan-bases, and just like nostalgic theme park
                  fans, they want to feel connected with places they associate
                  with recreation, learning, and family. Museums can take
                  ownership of their body of exhibition work and their own
                  nostalgic legacy by creating VR exhibits for their audiences
                  that help them remember, connect, and continue to learn even
                  long after an exhibit has been taken down. By doing so, they
                  can control their relationship to their audiences now, and to
                  audiences in the future looking back at what once was.
