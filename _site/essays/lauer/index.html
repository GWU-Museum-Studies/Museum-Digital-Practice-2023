                  Imagine you show up to a museum where you are unable to read
                  any of the information, to listen to the docents and guides,
                  or even determine where the bathrooms are located. Maybe it’s
                  a museum in a foreign country. Maybe it’s the museum in your
                  own neighborhood. Either way, that museum is inaccessible to
                  you. Now imagine that in the palm of your hand is a device
                  that can help you read, listen, and find what you are looking
                  for through instant translation of text and speech. While this
                  kind of device is still limited to sci-fi novels and movies,
                  this ability could soon be available to us as machine
                  translation continues to be perfected. As the technology
                  stands now, there are still limitations to what machine
                  translators are able to do, but they can be a helpful tool for
                  museums to use to help expand their community outreach and
                  better serve their multilingual visitors when used in
                  conjunction with human translators.

                  According to US Census Bureau data from 2018-2019, nearly 68
                  million in the United States people speak a language other
                  than English (LOTE) at home. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">US Census 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">U.S. Census Bureau. “Nearly 68 Million People Spoke a

                  1980, it is clear that non-native English speakers are a
                  growing part of the American population. In some states, 1 in
                  3 people speak a LOTE at home.

                  includes over 2 million households, around a third of the LOTE
                  speakers responded that in their own opinion they speak
                  English “less than very well.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">US Census 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">U.S. Census Bureau. “Nearly 68 Million People Spoke a

                  the opportunity to target these members of their communities.
                  By creating materials in other languages, people may feel more
                  accepted and welcome in a museum. They will also likely be
                  able to learn more about the museum and its collections than
                  if they walked around an exhibit with text in a language they
                  do not speak and be able to ask questions and engage.

                  Many different forms of communication exist within museums
                  that would necessitate translation within a multilingual
                  museum. In her
                  <em>Survey of Translation Practices in Museums,</em> the
                  Manager of Interpretive Media and Resources for the National
                  Gallery of Art, Reema Ghazi found that about half the 26
                  surveyed museums regularly translated wall text, labels, maps,
                  interpretive brochures, and resources for families.

                  rarely translated. This is likely because interactive and

                  simple text labels. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Kushner Bishop 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Kushner Bishop, Jill. “Engaging Multilingual Audiences

                  larger sample size in different types of museums would give
                  stronger evidence of the field as a whole.

                  does give some insight to the reasons for early adopters of
                  translation in museums. Over half of the U.S. museums surveyed
                  in 2009 said that the most common reason for multilingual
                  offerings was an institutional mandate to make exhibits and

                <h3>The Limitations of Human Translation</h3>
                <p>
                  Museums often face the challenge of limited resources.
                  Translation services can be prohibitively costly. While the
                  cost can vary, professional translation services for
                  translating the wall text for an exhibit into one other
                  language can cost thousands to tens of thousands of dollars.
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ghazi 2022, 506</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ghazi, Reema. “Translation Practices in Museums: What the

                  including the number of words to be translated, the language
                  that it is being translated to, the content type, turnaround
                  time, and the expertise of the translators.

                      <a href="https://eriksen.com/faqs/" target="_blank">https://eriksen.com/faqs/</a>.</span></cite>) Generally, a professional translator costs around $0.10 to
                  $0.30 per word, so a single label with 150 words would cost
                  between $15 and $45. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Bagińska 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Justyna Bagińska, “How Much Does It Cost to Hire a

                  Beyond the price of the translation itself, there are other
                  costs associated with translated text. Languages take up
                  different amounts of space on a wall or page even when they
                  are direct translations. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ghazi 2022, 506</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ghazi, Reema. “Translation Practices in Museums: What the

                  fonts to create all of the characters in that language.

                  In order to cut down on the cost of translation, museums may
                  apply for grants or raise money, but often they rely heavily
                  on bilingual staff to perform translation services. Ghazi’s
                  survey determined that about 75% of museums handled their
                  translation internally by staff, volunteers, or board members.

                  job descriptions though, so employees are being asked to use
                  their language skills beyond what is expected of the position
                  and what may be beyond their actual language skills.

                  huge part of converting text between two languages,
                  translation is a skill all of its own. Professional
                  translators and interpreters adhere to ethical guidelines for
                  the field of interpretation, such as confidentiality and
                  translating accurately without personal bias.

                  are not likely to receive any training or evaluation of their
                  translation skills before being used to translate materials.
                  This puts undue burden on the bilingual staff to perform
                  beyond the scope of their knowledge and expertise. They may
                  feel pressured to do the translations on behalf of their own
                  communities even though those communities would best be served
                  by professional translators.

                  Humans also have limitations in their knowledge of different
                  languages. There are certainly some polyglots who know more
                  than a couple of languages, but no one can store the hundreds
                  of different languages that exist in our world. Each time a
                  museum wants to offer their content in additional languages,
                  they have to find a new translator which will double the costs
                  discussed above. To offer live programs like tours, museums
                  may have to hire another staff member who is able to speak
                  that language. These human resource costs add to the overall
                  difficulties of a museum to provide interpreted information to
                  their visitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Human translation of written text also requires another
                  limited resource in museums, time. Generally, a translator
                  works on about 2000-2500 words per day. That is equivalent to
                  about 15 labels of 150 words. In a large exhibit, it could
                  take weeks to get all of the text translated. Because the
                  wording of labels may be edited multiple times throughout
                  development of an exhibit or program, that means that the
                  translator will need to return to edit sections they already
                  completed. If there are last minute edits to the original
                  text, those changes need to be reflected in the translation
                  and this could lead to delays in production if the translator
                  is not given enough time to complete the changes and lead to a
                  lesser quality of translation. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Avantpage 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Avantpage. “How To Not Save Money On Your Translation

                  increase the cost of the overall project.

                  With the limitations of human translators and the strain that
                  translation can put on resources, finding solutions to these
                  problems is imperative for museums to be able to offer
                  materials and programs in multiple languages. Translation
                  technology has existed for decades and continues to improve.
                  It may offer a solution to many of the obstacles that prevent
                  museums from presenting information in multiple languages to
                  their guests.

                <h3>Introduction to Machine Translation</h3>
                <p>
                  While ideas of how to easily translate between two languages
                  had existed for a long time, the first use of machine
                  translation can be dated back to 1933 when French scientist
                  George Artsrouni patented his idea for a mechanical
                  translation device which he called the “mechanical brain.”

                  tape that was meant to help retrieve stored information
                  quickly. One application that he pictured was producing
                  word-for-word translations. He first successfully demonstrated
                  the device in 1937. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Akbari 2014</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Akbari, Alireza. “An Overall Perspective of Machine

                <p>
                  World War II spurred on translation technology research by the
                  military and by the 1950s, multiple universities had begun
                  research on mechanical translation including Massachusetts
                  Institute of Technology (MIT), University of Washington
                  Seattle, and University of California Los Angeles. MIT hosted
                  the first conference on machine translation in 1952. The field
                  continued to grow slowly from there over the next few decades
                  as it was difficult and costly to research. In the late 1980s,
                  IBM researchers published an article about statistical
                  approaches that led to increasing the power of computers and
                  the capacity of their memory as well as decreasing costs. This
                  helped researchers develop a new “example based” approach to
                  translation. This new statistical technique “translates the
                  phrase and words based on earlier translated texts.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Sreelekha 2016, 234-235</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Sreelekha, S. “A Survey Report on Evolution of Machine

                  During the 21<sup>st</sup> century, translation tools have
                  continued to improve rapidly. The early online translation
                  tools used the phrase-based statistical methods developed in
                  the 1980s. Today, many of the most common machine translation
                  tools–including the most popular tool Google Translate (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Elliot 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Elliott, Christopher. “The Best Translation Apps and

                  translation (NMT). NMT has faster, more accurate translations
                  than the previous types of machine translations. Rather than
                  translating a word or phrase individually, NMT produces
                  translations of whole sentences by pulling from data sets and
                  language modeling to better understand the context of the
                  whole text. This creates a more human-like quality to the
                  translations.
                </p>
                <h3>Machine Translation, a Fix?</h3>
                <p>
                  Machine translation tools are able to address some of the
                  biggest limitations of human translators. For museums that
                  have limited budgets or resources, machine translators are a
                  cost saving measure. There are many free text machine
                  translators such as the most popular one, Google Translate.
                  Machine Translators can translate into hundreds of different
                  languages and dialects, so museums are able to provide
                  materials in many languages without raising the cost of
                  translation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Machine translation tools are also much quicker than human
                  translators. Machine translation only takes a matter of
                  seconds rather than days or weeks. Machine translation tools
                  are available all day, every day which allows for last minute
                  changes to be made to the text in exhibits or promotional
                  materials without a delay.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With all of the benefits of machine translation, it would seem
                  to be the ideal tool for museums, but one of the biggest
                  limitations of machine translation is accuracy. While NMT has
                  greatly improved the quality of translation compared with
                  previous translation tools, it still does not provide the same
                  understanding of language as a human translator.

                  understanding of the different variations of words is limited
                  to those included in the training. It also struggles with
                  expressions. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Zhang 2022, 179</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Zhang, Hong. “Comparison between Human Translation and

                  figure of speech rather than the individual words. NMT is
                  unsuccessful in understanding and transforming the expression
                  into an equivalent meaning in the target language. NMT is
                  attempting to copy the human thinking process, but still has a
                  long way to go. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Zhang 2022, 180</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Zhang, Hong. “Comparison between Human Translation and

                <p>
                  In addition to its inaccuracy, machine translation is only as
                  good as the data it was trained on. NMT falls victim to a
                  problem with many forms of artificial intelligence with
                  limited data sets: bias. Nearly 30% of text on the internet is
                  in English, so the tools have plenty of material to pull from
                  for English translations. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Che Wai Peh 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Che Wei Peh, Clara. “Is AI Generating an ‘Averaged’,

                  for machines to be able to pull from which can make the
                  translations even more inaccurate. The translations may even
                  be inappropriate or offensive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These two issues balance out the benefits of machine
                  translation. An inaccurate translation can have detrimental
                  results. Without someone who speaks the target language to
                  review the translations, museums risk insulting their visitors
                  and making them feel unwelcome or unwanted which goes against
                  the goals of introducing translated materials. However, this
                  does not mean that machine translation should be totally
                  eliminated. Museums can hire human translation editors to
                  review the machine translated materials for less than the cost
                  of a full translation which would help to address the major
                  concerns of NMT. Another form of machine translation that is
                  gaining popularity is computer-aided translation (CAT). CAT is
                  a type of software that reduces the work of human translators.
                  They include different tools that speed up the process like
                  translation memory. Essentially translation memory pulls from
                  the work that a human translator has already completed. Say a
                  sentence or phrase is used multiple times in a project, the
                  computer will save the translation and apply it to the later
                  uses in the project. With time saved by the translator, money
                  and resources are also saved by the museum. The discount can
                  range from around 5% to 25% depending on the company and the
                  repetitions used in the project.

                  solution, but it can help to reduce the overall costs for
                  museums.

                  While this paper has focused so far primarily on text
                  translations because these are the most common forms of

                  translation in live educational programs because this is a

                  LOTE-speaking visitors in the United States. If they want to
                  be able to ask questions and engage with museum staff or take
                  a live tour with a docent, they need to be able to listen and
                  speak the language of the staff member or the staff member
                  needs to speak the visitor’s language. For live programs,
                  there are a number of emerging devices that promise
                  simultaneous translation.

                  Unfortunately, the device does not seem to live up to all that
                  is promised. According to reviews on the App Store, the
                  translations are not entirely accurate and the differences in
                  the dialects are negligible. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">App Store 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">App Store. “Ambassador Interpreter.” Apple Inc. Accessed

                  enunciation for accurate translations which creates a stunted,
                  unnatural speech pattern. The devices are only able to be used
                  in a visitor’s right ear and cannot comfortably be used on the
                  left which could be a problem for visitors with limited
                  hearing in one ear.

                  The United States Capitol in Washington, DC is providing tours
                  in Spanish and Mandarin using a Travis the Translator device.
                  The Capitol offers the language tours once a day in the
                  morning. The Capitol Visitor Center’s website does not provide
                  as much information about their device as the Tenement Museum.
                  It only says that “guides lead the tour with a translation
                  device.”(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">US Capitol 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. “Foreign Language Tours.”

                  about the tours in English, Spanish, and Mandarin while the
                  Tenement Museum only provides the information on their tours
                  on their website in English. Unlike the Ambassador, it does
                  not require a separate user device like a phone or tablet to
                  be usable. The device is able to be used on its own and can be
                  played out loud for visitors to listen or can be with the
                  microphone and assisted listening devices the Capitol uses for
                  its standard English tours. The device allows for translation
                  to and from both the language of the guide and the language of
                  the visitor, so visitors are able to ask questions while on
                  tour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my experience as a tour guide at the Capitol Visitor
                  Center, the tours I have led at the Capitol have had many of
                  the same problems as the Tenement Museum. The Travis device is
                  unable to keep up with human speech in real time unless the
                  speaker uses short, simple sentences. The Travis device can
                  take a few seconds to load and produce the target language
                  which means the speaker must wait for the processing to
                  complete before being able to continue speaking. The
                  translations are not always accurate or lack nuance which
                  leads to confusion among visitors. For example, when speaking
                  about a statue of the Ponca leader Chief Standing Bear
                  recently, the device translated his name as “jefe oso de pie”
                  or “boss bear standing.” Visitors then asked where the bear
                  was held in the Capitol. I do not speak fluent Spanish and
                  have no knowledge of Mandarin, so I am unable to recognize
                  when the translations are not correct unless a visitor
                  communicated confusion. A Spanish speaking tour guide would
                  have been able to better explain that the phrase was his name
                  and title rather than referring to a literal bear.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Devices like the Ambassador Interpreter and Travis the
                  Translator rely on the same NMT systems as text translations,
                  so they are subject to the same problems and more.
                  Additionally, voice translation devices require speech
                  recognition and speech synthesis software to work. This leads
                  to more systems that can produce errors. For example, the
                  Travis device registered me saying “that man” as “Batman” on
                  one of my tours and translated it as such. With text
                  translations, museums are able to edit materials before
                  presenting them to the public, but with live translations
                  there is no quality assurance testing. Until the technology
                  improves, hiring presenters who can speak the target language
                  still seems to be the best option for live programs.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                  Translation technology can address some of the issues that
                  acts as a barrier for museums, but the technology still needs
                  to improve before it can replace the human element that
                  language requires. The translation field continues to be
                  improved every day, so it may not be long until it is able to
                  equal human translations, but in the meantime, it can still be
                  used as a tool to assist people. Computer Assisted Translation
                  can help reduce the cost of text translations. Although voice
                  translation devices may not be ideal for translating entire
                  programs, they could be utilized for visitors to ask questions
                  as they navigate museums. Until the technology improves,
                  museums should continue to invest in making their content
                  accessible to all.
