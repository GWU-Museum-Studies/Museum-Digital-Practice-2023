                  The Holocaust is the history of great tragedy and trauma. The
                  Holocaust claimed the lives of over six million European Jews
                  and over five million non-Jewish people. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 2</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Holocaust

                  industrialized the killing of those they considered a threat.
                  The main focus of their destruction were the Jewish people of
                  Germany and the countries that they conquered. As the war was
                  concluding the Allied forces came across the concentration
                  camps where much of the industrialized killing took place.
                  Though the Nazis tried to disguise the purpose of such camps
                  and their deeds, the survivors found clinging to life in the
                  camps were clear evidence of what the Nazis tried to hide.

                  After the end of World War II, the documentation of the extent
                  of the Nazi’s atrocities began. While in the final stages of
                  the war Nazi soldiers attempted to destroy the evidence of
                  what had occurred, there was much documentation of the
                  Holocaust remaining for the Allies to discover. Documentation
                  and the physical sites were important in discovering the scale
                  and inner workings of the Final Solution, however, the
                  survivors themselves were a key resource to understanding the
                  horrors that were inflicted. Many of the survivors have spent
                  a great deal of their time after the Holocaust detailing what
                  exactly happened to them during the war. Whether through
                  written means, a journal, or an article, or through talks that
                  they give to those willing to listen. The documentation given
                  by the survivors is an extremely powerful tool to combat the
                  ever-growing denial of the Holocaust. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 1</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Holocaust

                  Despite the large volume of evidence, both physical and oral,
                  denial of the Holocaust has existed since the beginning stages
                  of the discovery. At first it was the Nazis attempting to save
                  themselves from the punishments for the atrocities they had
                  committed. However, even so many decades past the event, there
                  are a great deal more deniers than ever. Widespread
                  disinformation has been disseminated by the internet,
                  contributing to the growing problem. Much of this denial
                  centers around discrediting the survivors and witnesses. Those
                  who deny the Holocaust tend to downplay what happened and
                  minimize what losses happened if they do say that any happened
                  at all. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 1</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Holocaust

                  strongest tools to push back against the deniers is the voices
                  and stories of the survivors.

                  Ever since the end of the war many organizations have created
                  ways to record the stories of those who witnessed the events
                  that took place. With the improvements in technology, digital
                  recordings have provided a way to preserve the voices and
                  faces of those telling the harrowing stories of survival and
                  pain. With the numbers of survivors ever dwindling, these
                  recordings are extremely important to preserve the words and
                  emotions felt by the survivors. Recording the stories has
                  enabled a great deal of information to be kept safe from the
                  decay of memory and the destruction of physical evidence.

                  While the written word is powerful, an oral history recording
                  helps to preserve the emotions in the voice and the face of
                  the speaker. These emotions help evoke empathy and sympathy
                  from the viewer in a stronger way than the written word.

                  championed the stories of the survivors of the Holocaust. The
                  United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s mission statement is

                    The Museum’s primary mission is to advance and disseminate
                    knowledge about this unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the
                    memory of those who suffered; and to encourage its visitors
                    to reflect upon the moral and spiritual questions raised by
                    the events of the Holocaust. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 3</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Mission and

                <p>
                  This mission statement declares the museum’s intention to
                  educate their visitors of the history of the Holocaust and how
                  the echoes continue to affect the world today. Through their
                  programing at the museum and their online resources the USHMM
                  does a great deal to preserve and circulate the information
                  that exists detailing the Holocaust.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The USHMM spends a great deal of effort to record the stories
                  of survivors and use these testimonies to educate the public.
                  They have a very large archive that can be accessed in person
                  through a request on their website. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 4</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Research in the

                  the Holocaust and those who did and did not survive it. They
                  also have a great deal of objects that can help tell the story
                  of the Holocaust. Many of the documentary and video-based
                  evidence is digitized. Their website has a page dedicated to
                  connecting viewers to different types of records to give
                  different perspectives and information. These include written
                  documentation and recorded videos of survivor’s testimony. As
                  well as the online archive on their website, the USHMM also
                  has a YouTube channel where they share videos, lectures, and
                  eye-witness accounts.

                <h2>The YouTube Channel</h2>
                <p>
                  The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s YouTube channel
                  was started in 2006, with their first video being in 2007.
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Wong 2011, 104</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Wong, Amelia S. “Ethical Issues of Social Media in

                  useful tool for many years. From the beginning the videos had
                  a strong focus on communicating the oral stories of those who
                  survived. Starting in 2013 videos (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdiuTwfJZzc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdiuTwfJZzc</a>) on the USHMM’s YouTube channel started to make use of
                  livestream technology to broadcast interviews and talks to a
                  wider audience than those who were able to make the lecture in
                  person. Today the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
                  maintains a strong presence on YouTube, posting some form of
                  content around twice a month. While survivor stories are
                  featured heavily, the YouTube channel does feature objects
                  from their collection, historian talks, stories of other
                  genocides, and many other types of videos. The large range of
                  content on their channel follows the USHMM’s mission to
                  “advance and disseminate knowledge.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 3</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Mission and

                  platform, a place that is easily found through internet
                  searches on the topic of the Holocaust, the United States
                  Holocaust Memorial Museum is able to reach out to a wider
                  audience than if they had kept all of their videos solely on
                  their website.
                </p>
                <p>
                  YouTube as a platform has multiple advantages making it a good
                  place for the USHMM to share and store videos on. By using
                  YouTube as a host, the USHMM is not bearing the burden of
                  storage for these videos. YouTube itself is an incredibly
                  successful and popular video sharing website so using it as a
                  platform can help increase engagement. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Wong 2011, 104</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Wong, Amelia S. “Ethical Issues of Social Media in

                  denial. In 2019 the platform banned speech that denied the
                  Holocaust. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Guhl and Davey 2020, 2</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Guhl, Jakob and Jacob Davey, “Hosting the ‘Holohoax’: A

                  certain buzzwords that were used in many of the videos and
                  comments that denied the Holocaust on the platform.

                  of the comment section of the USHMM’s videos much easier as
                  the platform’s policies now fully support such actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Institutions dealing with such heavy topics such as the
                  Holocaust, especially when the truth of the events are
                  directly under attack, need to curate their digital media
                  carefully. The decision on whether to allow dialogue in
                  comments under the videos is an important idea. Dialogue is a
                  good way to encourage public engagement with the content
                  produced, however, dialogue can bring in people acting in bad
                  faith. If only positive comments are allowed, this can be seen
                  as censorship of certain viewpoints. While perusing the
                  comments on the YouTube channel of the United States Holocaust
                  Memorial Museum I only saw positive comments, whether this is
                  due to their curation of the comment section or to the fact
                  that only those who are interested in the topic for positive
                  education are seeking out this information is unknown.
                  According to Amelia Wong, who had moderated the comments for
                  the USHMM’s YouTube channel, a set of criteria was developed
                  to prevent abuse, denial, and hate from spreading through the
                  comments on their videos. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Wong 2011, 104</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Wong, Amelia S. “Ethical Issues of Social Media in

                  before the changes of YouTube’s terms of service in 2019, so
                  it is unclear what exactly the affect of the changes have been
                  to the channel in general, but the current state of the
                  comments shows that a similar trend of keeping up the
                  positivity is continuing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since the conflict between Israel and Palestine broke out in
                  late 2023 all of their latest videos have had the comments
                  turned off. This could have been a preemptive attempt to avoid
                  conflict in the comments, or a response to comments that were
                  made as the conflict began in earnest. Either way, clearly the
                  moderators of the YouTube channel have had to adjust their
                  strategy based on the current events happening in Israel.
                  While silencing the ability for discussion is something that
                  Wong had written was not something that the USHMM was
                  interested in, clearly the conflict has created a need for
                  extra protections and safeguards for the channel’s health.

                  A newer part of the USHMM’s channel is the inclusion of
                  shorts. YouTube Shorts are videos that are of 60 seconds or
                  less duration. Shorts are YouTube’s attempt to find the
                  popularity of Vine or TikTok with the short video format.
                  Often these short video formats are used to grab the attention
                  for a brief period before moving on to the next video. While
                  shorts are an interesting approach to appealing to the
                  attention span of the current generation, some might think
                  that they are lacking the context needed to fully understand
                  the story. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Pagenstecher 2018, 117</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Pagenstecher, Cord. “Testimonies in Digital Environments:

                  to be generally less meaningful and less engaging than what
                  the subject matter seems to dictate. The USHMM has used the
                  format of the Short in a couple different ways, some of which
                  seem to fit the tone of the rest of the channel, while one
                  series of three videos does not.

                  Majority of the shorts on the channel are the videos in the
                  series “Truth Is…”. These shorts focus on the physical
                  evidence left behind by the Holocaust. In the 60 second videos
                  an object is presented by the survivor that it is attached to.
                  The survivor describes the object and how it shows the truth
                  of their story. The objects range from a photograph of their
                  family to a doll, to an ID card. The wide range of objects,
                  from innocent to sinister show the true scope of how people
                  were affected by the Holocaust and the memories that were
                  tainted by it. There are a couple of videos that tell the
                  stories of victims and survivors but without narration,
                  relying solely on text to give context to the images shown.
                  Overall, these fit the general theme of the rest of the
                  YouTube channel, using the survivors’ stories to explore the
                  truth in the history of the Holocaust.

                  There are three shorts that drastically deviate from the rest

                  answering two questions that were posed in the comments of the
                  first short. This type of question-and-answer video is fairly
                  common in the short form video format. However, to me this
                  format feels very lighthearted and lacking the gravity that
                  the rest of the channel provides. The two questions that Mr.
                  Jampoler answered,
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/glUAUi0ufZQ" target="_blank">“Do you know exactly who saved you?”</a>(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM Youtube 1</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Do you know

                  drastic difference in the tone and style of the video was
                  quite jarring. The short format of the video did not allow for
                  Mr. Jampoler to elaborate on his answers, nor even to finish
                  his thoughts as the first of the two answers was cut off due
                  to the short format.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While a question-and-answer format would be a good way to
                  continue to educate the audience of the YouTube channel, using
                  the Shorts question and answer format would be a mistake. With
                  the live technology that the USHMM has been using for many
                  years already, a question-and-answer livestream would allow
                  for a more natural flow and for the answers to be complete and
                  fully fleshed out. Overall, the Shorts format does not fully
                  remove the context as some might worry it would, but only if
                  the videos are very carefully crafted. The biggest problem
                  would be the fact that these shorts can be mixed into the
                  algorithm and be shown in the middle of inappropriate videos
                  given the content and theme of the USHMM’s Shorts.

                <p>
                  As time moves forward the available living memory of the
                  Holocaust shrinks. Survivors die out and their voices and
                  testimonies are lost. We find ourselves further and further
                  removed from the horrors of the Holocaust. As the twenty-first
                  century proceeds, humanity finds itself facing one crisis
                  after another. This constant flood of trauma and pain through
                  the media has desensitized the general populace to such
                  horrors. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Clark 2005, 266</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Clark, Mary Marshall. “Holocaust Video Testimony, Oral

                  Social media platforms operate based on continuous bombardment
                  of information and media that has led to mental fatigue and
                  lack of attention span in its users. This lack of attention
                  can lead to issues with the proper contextualization of the
                  trauma and the pain that the videos of the USHMM are trying to
                  convey. While the visual imagery of the survivor telling their
                  story is powerful, the indifference of a modern or future
                  viewer may render all of the effort pointless.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With modern pain dulling the shock of the past, how can
                  institutions like the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
                  keep modern audiences engaged with their message? Their
                  YouTube series
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWQC3P4psZP4_DifJjcRahhzYwXkKCV29" target="_blank">Eyewitness to History</a>
                  is a treasured archive of the testimonies of the survivors of
                  the Holocaust. The engagement with the videos is often
                  positive, however the previous curation of the comment section
                  and the current disabling of comments, makes it difficult to
                  know what exactly the engagement of the channel is. With the
                  current conflict in Palestine causing a great deal of
                  attention to be drawn to the subject of the Holocaust, there
                  is as great a need as ever for channels like the USHMM to
                  continue producing content that can get through the mental
                  fatigue and grab the attention of those searching for
                  information. By using YouTube Shorts, the USHMM has a chance
                  to take advantage of the short form media to transmit small
                  snippets of information to an audience that may not have been
                  seeking out information directly like with their other videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With evolving media technologies and strategies, the USHMM
                  seems primed to continue using social media and digital
                  content to spread awareness and education. With continued use
                  of their digital collections and carefully curated content,
                  there is a great deal of possibility in their YouTube channel.
                  The use of Shorts may assist in their ability to reach a
                  previously untapped audience, as the YouTube algorithm works
                  its magic. As long as the social media curators continue to
                  respect the tone and themes that they are bound by, there is a
                  lot that can be achieved by their current model.
