                  More than simply buildings with exhibitions, museums seem to
                  have a specific cultural identity about them: marble columns,
                  grand atriums, security guards in every other room. But this
                  idea may not be entirely accurate anymore. As with nearly
                  everything in Western society, the internet has brought great
                  changes to the world of museums. Many major institutions have
                  at least partially digitized, publicly available collections;
                  museums have also adapted to innovations like social media to
                  further attendance. Alongside museums’ development in the
                  twenty-first century, video games have arisen as one of the
                  most popular art forms. Today, it seems impossible to walk
                  into a room of twelve-year-olds and not hear a mention of
                  Fortnite. Three games in particular–
                  <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em>,
                  <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em>, and <em>Dark Souls III</em>–
                  each show a potential example of video-game-as-museum. Through
                  video games, museums may well be able to find a path forward
                  in a rapidly changing, digitally-focused world.

                <p>
                  First, however, it is important to define what a museum
                  actually is. This may seem simple at first, but it is a
                  deceptively difficult question. After all, what is it that
                  links a grand, national museum like the Smithsonians and a
                  tiny, one-room, community focused space like New York City’s
                  Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space? (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">MORUS</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">‘Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space.’ MORUS. Accessed

                      <a href="http://www.morusnyc.org" target="_blank">http://www.morusnyc.org</a></span></cite>) Historians Carol Duncan and Alan Wallach propose that
                  museums, at their core, serve as ritually and ceremonially
                  important spaces, residing in the same social space as
                  “churches, shrines, and… palaces.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Duncan Wallach 1980, 449</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Duncan, Carol, and Alan Wallach. 1980. “The Universal
                      Survey Museum.” <em>Art History</em> 3 (4): 448-69.</span></cite>) Today’s large, less independent museums (or at least the
                  museums when Duncan and Wallach were writing) serve to educate
                  the public, yes, but they also serve as concrete examples of
                  the state’s power.

                  ICOM (the International Council of Museums) gives a more
                  concrete (although very recently updated) definition:

                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    A museum is a not-for-profit, permanent institution in the
                    service of society that researches, collects, conserves,
                    interprets and exhibits tangible and intangible heritage.
                    Open to the public, accessible and inclusive, museums foster
                    diversity and sustainability. They operate and communicate
                    ethically, professionally and with the participation of
                    communities, offering varied experiences for education,
                    enjoyment, reflection and knowledge sharing.

                  Both of these definitions have problems, however. It is hard
                  to imagine a museum as innocuous as San Francisco’s
                  Exploratorium as an extension of state power; at the same time
                  the Exporatorium lacks traditional collections.<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Exploratorium</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">‘Exploratorium.’ Exploratorium.

                  Despite this, it seems fairly obvious that the Exploratorium
                  is, indeed, still a museum.

                  Janet Marstine posits a more nuanced approach to the question,
                  although perhaps not a satisfying one. To Marstine, there are
                  four grand metaphors that can apply to some museums: “shrine,
                  market-driven industry, colonizing space, and post-museum.”
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Marstine 2008, 8-9</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Marstine, Janet. 2008.

                      Newark: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated.</span></cite>) Shrine museums, similar to Duncan and Wallach’s definition,
                  serve as a shrine, or a space to worship something; an example
                  could be the National Museum of American History. While NMAH
                  does not give an uncritical view of this country’s past, it
                  still does serve to celebrate American history. Market-driven
                  museums, despite the somewhat condescending name, are museums
                  that seek to “‘give in’” to market demands, choosing to cater
                  to visitors instead of some lofty ideal of what a museum
                  should be. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Marstine 2008, 10</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Marstine, Janet. 2008.

                      Newark: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated.</span></cite>) Colonizing spaces, as the name suggests, are museums whose
                  collections are formed from the spoils of imperialism, using
                  the “‘other’ to construct and justify the ‘self.’” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Marstine 2008, 14</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Marstine, Janet. 2008.

                      Newark: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated.</span></cite>) The post museum is the least helpful metaphor for defining
                  museums, as it deals with the theoretical; it is a museum that
                  has transcended museums, serving less a repository for
                  knowledge and more as a way to better its community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, what is a museum? Well, it’s a space that, through one or
                  more of Marstine’s four metaphors, focuses on educating the
                  public about a specific topic, while often functioning as a
                  societal and social ritual. Some, like the British Museum, use
                  the excuse of public education to flaunt colonial plunder;
                  others, like the Exploratorium generally just want to teach
                  the public cool things about science. It is impossible to come
                  to a full definition, however. No matter how broad or specific
                  a definition is, there will always be spaces that fall outside
                  of it: are zoos and aquariums museums? Are libraries? There is
                  not, and will never be, a fully satisfactory definition.

                <p>
                  Defining video games is quite a bit easier: a game where
                  players use various methods of input to control and manipulate
                  moving images created by a computer program. This definition
                  is an intentionally open one: not all video games involve
                  killing enemies or chasing a high score. Some feel more like
                  pieces of art, or even entire galleries thereof. Take Asmik
                  Ace Entertainment’s <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em>, for example.
                  Directly inspired by one of the developer’s decades-spanning
                  dream journals, the game has players travel through and
                  explore incoherent, dream-like spaces.[8] After each level (if
                  they even be called that), the player is placed on a quadrant
                  chart with “downer” and “upper” as the x-axes and “static” and
                  “dynamic” as the y-axes. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Sato 1998</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Sato, Osamu, dir. 1998. <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em>.

                  <em>LSD</em> is a video game, yes, but it doesn’t really
                  behave like a game. The player is never scored; there are no
                  other characters you can interact with; there isn’t even much
                  gameplay besides walking around and observing the art. Much
                  like, say, an art gallery. Ignoring the fact that it exists
                  not as a physical structure, can
                  <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em> be considered a museum? The
                  player isn’t really taught anything, but the same could be
                  said about art museums whose labels include little more than
                  the artist, the medium, and the year painted. The deciding
                  factor, then, should be intent: are these video games or other
                  digital media projects intended to be treated like a museum?
                  For <em>LSD</em>, the answer seems to be no. It functions as
                  more an individual art piece, something to be displayed in and
                  of itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>LSD Dream Emulator</em> is by far not the only not-game
                  video game to take on the language of art and museums. In
                  November of 2021, British art-rock band Radiohead released
                  <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em>. The game is best described
                  as a visual arts museum dedicated to albums <em>Kid A</em> and
                  <em>Amnesiac</em>; each song given a room with surreal,
                  occasionally unsettling accompanying visuals. It may not exist
                  in the real world, but the intention for this to be an actual,
                  physical museum space was there from the start.

                  Thom Yorke, Radiohead’s frontman, and Stanley Donwood,
                  Radiohead’s main artist, both initially wanted Kid A Mnesia to
                  be an exhibit at the U.K.’s Victoria and Albert Museum.
                  Intending to create the space by welding together shipping
                  containers, the pair wanted it to look out of place in
                  Victoria and Albert’s classical architecture, forcing it into
                  London like an “ice pick into Trotsky.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Yorke 2021</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Yorke, Thom. 2021.

The exhibit couldn’t exist at
                  the V&amp;A without serious structural damages; the
                  Westminster council denied a change of location to the Royal
                  Albert Hall; finally, COVID-19 hit and fully denied any plans
                  of a physical exhibition space.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In many ways, <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> is more video game than
                  museum. It has a pause menu and lets you “run” with the shift
                  key; the exhibit even saves your progress if you close it and
                  then reopen at a later time. But the game has a deeply vested
                  interest in recreating the visual language of museums. Its
                  rooms contain visible fire extinguishers, camera, and digital
                  stick-figure maintenance staff; the walls guide players along
                  much like at a “real” museum. It even recreates a
                  near-universal museum experience: walking into a part of an
                  exhibit with a short film and needing to wait an awkward
                  amount of time for it to restart. Except, in this case, the
                  short film is distorted footage of Thom Yorke creating a song
                  with various synthesizers and the other museum patron in the
                  room is a white, paper-mache imp staring directly at you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em> is a museum, then it
                  should be able to be described by one of Marstine’s four
                  metaphors. It certainly isn’t a colonizing space, nor is it a
                  market-driven industry; the game, after all, is free. It does
                  match the criteria to be a shrine, however— a shrine, more
                  specifically, to the paired albums of <em>Kid A</em> and
                  <em>Amnesiac</em>. More traditional art museums have a similar
                  lack of explanation or education about their works, simply
                  displaying each piece with its title and author, much like
                  <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> has. Despite its video game-based
                  idiosyncrasies, <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> truly does seem to
                  function as a museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Video games also have the potential to serve as tools of
                  learning beyond just mimicking museums. After all, games are
                  already primed to teach— it is impossible to pick up a new
                  game without, in some manner, the game teaching its players
                  new mechanics. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Anderson 2019, 178</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Anderson, Sky LaRell. “The Interactive Museum: Video

                  its world. Take, for example, <em>Dark Souls III</em>, a
                  notoriously difficult action role-playing by studio From
                  Software. Beyond being difficult, the Dark Souls series is
                  known for having lore that players need to work to learn
                  about, spawning droves of YouTube accounts dedicated to
                  learning about the games’ worlds. The similarities to
                  real-world history are easily apparent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Much of the lore in <em>Dark Souls III</em> comes from the
                  descriptions of various in-game items. As these descriptions
                  are some of the only ways of learning the history of the
                  game’s world, dedicated players spend great amounts of time
                  delving into the descriptions. Valorheart, a combination sword
                  and shield, is no exception, as its description sheds light on
                  some minor aspects of the game’s world:
                </p>
                <p>
                  Weapon once wielded by the Champion of the Undead Match. A
                  special paired set consisting of a broad sword and a lion
                  shield.<br>
                  The champion fought on, without rest, until he lost his mind.
                  In the end, only his page and a lone wolf stayed at his side.
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Miyazaki 2016</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Miyazaki, Hidetaki, dir. 2016. <em>Dark Souls III</em>.
                      Bandai Namco Entertainment.</span></cite>)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Much can be gleaned from just this short description. First,
                  whatever society this Champion belonged to used to value
                  gladiatorial combat between various undead people and was
                  structured enough to have pages— that is, knights’ assistants.
                  Additionally, it may have viewed the lion as an important
                  symbol, given its presence on Valorheart’s shield.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While it of course has its differences, this process is not
                  dissimilar to real life history. Players and historians both
                  have to make inferences about past societies using only what
                  these cultures left behind, whether it be real, written
                  accounts or fictional item descriptions.
                  <em>Dark Souls III</em> is by no means an educational title,
                  but it shows how games can be used to teach. This goes beyond
                  just self-identified educational games, as those “tend to be
                  boring, monotonous, and frankly not very well-designed
                  visually, mechanically, or even pedagogically.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Anderson 2019, 191</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Anderson, Sky LaRell. “The Interactive Museum: Video

                  for potentially hours, something which traditional methods of
                  education rarely are able to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Games cannot, of course, outright replace traditional methods
                  of education like classes or textbooks. Instead, they can
                  function as methods of “tangential learning,” in which the
                  education takes place in the background, almost unnoticed,
                  while the main focus for the player is the game itself.

                  tangential learning to teach players about their game’s lore
                  without taking them out of the play experience, a technique
                  which could easily be used for real-world education.

                  In their individual ways, <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em>,
                  <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em>, and
                  <em>Dark Souls III</em> each showcase the benefits— and
                  potential pitfalls— of video games as museums. <em>LSD</em> is
                  perhaps the least museum-esque of the three, but it serves as
                  an example of video games as art. Like some museums that lack
                  interpretative labels, the game leaves its players (or perhaps
                  viewers) to interpret the art for themselves, allowing them to
                  each make their own distinct interpretations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> most directly represents the visual
                  design and visual language of museums. Radiohead was very
                  interested in recreating the experience of going to a museum,
                  while making use of the unique properties of video games to
                  create an experience more abstract than would be possible with
                  a real, brick-and-mortar museum. It also has the benefit of
                  being much more accessible than physical museums; while it
                  does require that players have a powerful enough computer to
                  run the program and have a general knowledge of how to play
                  first-person video games, anyone regardless of physical
                  location is able to play the game. There are also fewer
                  (although not zero) barriers with those with physical
                  disabilities, as there are no possibilities of inaccessible
                  bathrooms or lack of wheelchair-friendly ramps, for example.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> does not teach its players
                  anything, at least not directly. Most art museums, at least
                  American ones, have some interpretation. Labels explain the
                  artist’s history or inspirations; text on the walls explains
                  the overarching theme of an exhibit; docents answer visitors’
                  questions. The closest <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> comes to this is
                  the very beginning of the game, where some text on a wall
                  begins with modified lyrics from the band’s song “Pulk/Pull
                  Revolving Doors” followed by this somewhat cryptic poem:

                </figure>
                <p>
                  This begs the question: do museums need to be educational? Or
                  is the presentation of art in an interesting manner enough?
                  While Kid A Mnesia may at times look like a museum, calling
                  itself an exhibition and providing a museum-esque map at a
                  linked website, it often does not function like one. It
                  intentionally dehumanizes every other person in the space,
                  other “guests” and museum employees alike being rendered as
                  simple stick figures. Instead, the game uses the design space
                  of museums as background context to show the players its art
                  and its music, less interested in pedagogy and more interested
                  in evoking specific feelings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On top of all of that, Kid A Mnesia does not make use of video
                  games’ specific strengths as a medium; it uses its unreal
                  location to be able to create impossible geometry and layouts,
                  yes, but beyond that the experience is akin to that of going
                  to a physical museum. While that was probably intentional,
                  given the project’s initial roots as a real exhibit, video
                  games are capable of providing learning experiences in manners
                  wildly different from actual museums.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike <em>LSD Dream Emulator</em>, which functions more like
                  a piece of art than a game, and <em>Kid A Mnesia</em>, with
                  its interest in the visual language of museums,
                  <em>Dark Souls III</em> does not in any way try to mimic or
                  recreate real-world art or museums. Despite this, it still
                  manages to teach its players about its fictional setting in a
                  manner potentially more effective and engaging than
                  traditional classroom environments. What if, then, instead of
                  video games mimicking museums, museums mimicked video games?
                  In further exploration of this question, Seb Chan discusses
                  <em>Sleep No More</em>, an immersive theater experience
                  “loosely based on Macbeth [and] inspired by film noir.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Chan 2012</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Chan, Seb. 2012. “On Sleep No More, Magic and Immersive

                      23, 2012.</span></cite>) In the video game-esque production, mask-clad guests freely
                  wander the stage, gaining a highly unique and individualized
                  experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Museums have always been wary of overly theatrical
                  experiences, lest they be labeled as “charlatans.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Chan 2012</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Chan, Seb. 2012. “On Sleep No More, Magic and Immersive

                      23, 2012.</span></cite>) But that attitude betrays museums’ nineteenth century
                  popular roots— roots of cabinets of curiosities and freak
                  shows (despite the unsavory nature of the name) advertising
                  wonders like “‘miracles of modern medicine…’ [and] freak
                  shows.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Chan 2012</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Chan, Seb. 2012. “On Sleep No More, Magic and Immersive

                      23, 2012.</span></cite>) Museums could have a lot to gain from interactive
                  experiences like Sleep No More or video games writ large.<br>
                  To break the veil of academic professionalism, some of my
                  recent favorite museum experiences have come from heavily
                  interactive exhibits. Planet Word, a linguistics-focused
                  museum in Washington, D.C., has several very interactive
                  experiences. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Planet Word</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">‘Planet Word.’ Planet Word Museum. Accessed November
                      23rd, 2023.
                      <a href="https://planetwordmuseum.org/" target="_blank">https://planetwordmuseum.org/</a></span></cite>) These range from a collaborative lesson with a computer
                  about English etymology to helping an artificial intelligence
                  workshop its jokes. While not on the same level of
                  interactivity as <em>Sleep No More</em>, Planet Word’s
                  exhibits show how much more engaging non-linear, personalized
                  experiences can be. As a college linguistics major, I hardly
                  learned anything at Planet Word, but I nevertheless found it
                  all incredibly fun. Working with a group of fellow guests
                  trying to guess the language of origin of “shampoo” (Hindi)
                  was a more memorable experience than simply reading some text
                  on a wall discussing the origins of the word.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the world continues to further digitize, museums need to
                  digitize with it. Although I will always love museums, ranging
                  from the imposing federally funded affairs to the hyper-local,
                  low budget exhibits, they can be intimidating and difficult to
                  break into. I am not suggesting that museum docents should
                  lead guests to a video game console and have that be the
                  majority of the visit, but the inherent accessibility and
                  individuality of game-like experiences should be considered.
                  This could even be a step towards Marstine’s idealized “post
                  museum,” a community-focused endeavor that aims not to simply
                  collect and study but to engage with its visitors and local
                  community on a more personal level.
