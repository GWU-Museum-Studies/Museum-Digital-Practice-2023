                  With the development of technology, the typical museum visit
                  has evolved. The inclusion of hands-on or immersive technology
                  into museums is more commonplace than ever. Especially after
                  the pandemic, museums are looking to maintain the visitor
                  numbers by creating unique and interesting experiences.
                  Meanwhile, game-based learning has been understood for decades
                  to be beneficial to learners in a multitude of settings.
                  Whether in the classroom or informal learning environments
                  like museums, adding games to enhance learning has shown to
                  increase interest and retention. With ever-improving
                  technology, video games have been more widely accepted as a
                  possible tool for education. Another way museums are looking
                  to attract more visitors is through partnerships with
                  recognizable video game and media brands. There are three
                  exhibits that are currently on view that are partnerships
                  between museums and recognizable franchises. The three
                  partnerships are with the established franchises of Roblox,
                  Pokémon, and Animal Crossing. The partnerships range in scope,
                  from special exhibits to experiences that span the whole
                  museum. They also range in output from programs that are
                  mostly promotional to more of a game-based learning model.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the pervasive stigma that video games are only for
                  kids, the original audience for video games who grew up in the
                  80s and 90s are aging and now have kids of their own. Many of
                  the game franchises that are available now have been on the
                  market for multiple decades, with an enduring fan base. Museum
                  partnerships like those with Pokémon or games developed by
                  Nintendo, brands that have been popular for 30 years, have the
                  potential to bridge generations and create connections.
                  Connections that could add to a museum visit, if also well
                  designed and educational. With partnerships like that with
                  Roblox, the nostalgia factor is most likely not there, but
                  that does not limit the multigenerational potential of newer
                  games. If the game elements are intriguing enough, the whole
                  family can learn together, both the game and the educational
                  material.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though video games are played by many ages, these three
                  franchises are very popular with younger demographics. This
                  brand recognition can attract families with children, and lead
                  to the exposure of museums and museum learning to younger
                  people. The learning potential of a museum when in conjunction
                  with the resources and technological infrastructure that the
                  game companies supply could be indicative of what could be
                  possible for the future of game-based museum learning to
                  enhance museum visitor experience.

                  retention of content. For decades, educational video games
                  have been an established sector of the industry. Gaining
                  popularity in the 1980s, educational video games contrasted

                <p>
                  In
                  <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/13745860159/The-Replica" target="_blank">collaboration with <em>Roblox</em></a>, the Met launched its own app, called <em>Replica</em> in
                  2023 (available
                  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-met-replica/id6448757664?platform=iphone" target="_blank">on iOS</a>
                  and
                  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.verizon.replica&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank">Android</a>). <em>Replica</em> uses augmented reality (AR) that takes
                  advantage of the programmable nature of <em>Roblox</em>,
                  encouraging players to “collect” art and objects at the Met.
                  The <em>Roblox</em> partnership is not tied to a specific
                  exhibit, but instead uses a select number of pieces throughout
                  the whole museum The player can walk around the museum with a
                  smart device and “scan” the available objects with the
                  device’s camera. To find the available objects, the app
                  includes a museum map and geolocation feature, which senses
                  when the player is close to an available object. Once in the
                  correct room, the app also provides written clues and a
                  silhouette to help the player find the specific object. These
                  scavenger hunt-like features encourage discovery and
                  close-looking at the objects in the galleries. With some of
                  the pieces, such as the armor, the players can transfer them
                  to their <em>Roblox</em> account, enabling their virtual
                  avatar to wear the objects from the museum, creating an
                  interactive element beyond the trip to the museum.

                  The “sandbox” nature of <em>Roblox</em> has allowed for many
                  educational possibilities including those currently available
                  for the Metropolitan Museum in New York. <em>Roblox</em> is
                  one of the newer games to reach mass popularity status. Much
                  like the also massively popular game, <em>Minecraft</em>,
                  <em>Roblox</em> is a very flexible “sandbox” or open world
                  game. A sandbox game is one where players are able to build
                  their own experiences through programming. Despite being
                  developed decades ago, it only gained popularity in the late
                  2010’s especially with the under 12 demographic. Additionally,
                  <em>Roblox</em> exploded in popularity during the Covid-19
                  pandemic due to the ability to interact virtually with
                  friends. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Liao, 2020</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Liao, Shannon. “How Roblox became the ‘it’ game for

                  As a partnership, the one with the Met is successful as well
                  as it integrates the best parts of both parties. Replica
                  allows for the exploration of the Met’s enormous collection as
                  well as displays the versatility of Roblox as a game. The game
                  elements included in the Replica app achieve the self-directed
                  motivation often cited as a benefit for game-based

                  The players are able to wander the museum at their own
                  leisure, not following a set path, and discover the pieces
                  included in the game. Also maintaining the element of
                  engagement as there is a set number of objects to collect and
                  the added benefit of having the objects be digitally
                  functional after their visit to the Met. The player is
                  motivated to collect as many museum objects as they can. The
                  adaptability and graceful failure are maintained as well, but
                  more subtly. The silhouette and clues for the objects can
                  apply to multiple pieces, and because the Met’s collection is
                  so large and diverse, one set of armor, for example, might be
                  confused with another.

                  To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Amsterdam’s Van Gogh
                  Museum, <em>Pokémon</em> partnered with the museum on an

                  that centers around a fictional universe where characters
                  catch, train and battle powerful creatures called Pokémon. The
                  franchise includes digital media such movies, tv shows, and
                  video games as well as physical media including books, manga
                  and comics. The most well-known physical media created by the
                  franchise are the collectible <em>Pokémon</em> cards that can

                  In its 30-year history, <em>Pokémon</em> became a behemoth of
                  a media franchise. The Japanese company as a whole is the
                  largest media company in the world, and its video game sector
                  alone is in the top 5 in the video game industry.

                  started in the 1990s and has managed to maintain its cultural
                  relevance. The youngest target audience for
                  <em>Pokémon</em> is in the 8-12 year old range. However due to
                  its long staying power, the earliest fans are well into their
                  adulthood, and might want to share their love of the franchise
                  with their children.

                  The exhibit, titled, “<a href="https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/van-gogh-museum-x-pokemon" target="_blank"><em>Pokémon</em> at Van Gogh Museum</a>,” opened in September 2023, and runs until January 2024.
                  Though not an obvious pairing off the bat, it is meant to
                  reflect the appreciation that Van Gogh had for Japanese art
                  during his lifetime. The special exhibit includes six works of
                  art, where <em>Pokémon</em> are included in paintings inspired
                  by Van Gogh’s more notable works. There are two activities in
                  the exhibit. One includes instructions on how to draw Pikachu,
                  the most identifiable character in the franchise. The other
                  involves details and facts about Van Gogh’s life and his
                  relationship with Japanese art as described in a letter he
                  wrote to his brother. Additionally, there is a limited time
                  <em>Pokémon</em> card of Pikachu in the style of a Van Gogh
                  self-portrait sold in the museum’s gift shop. Since the
                  opening of the exhibit, the card was so popular that it sold
                  out quickly. The museum had to subsequently cancel the restock
                  due to “safety concerns” because the museum shop was being
                  mobbed by “alleged scalpers”. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Wong, 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Wong, Vicky. 2023. “Van Gogh Museum pulls Pokémon card

                  ability to bring people to the museum shows the power that
                  these partnerships can have for museum attendance.

                  At the time of writing, the exhibit is still ongoing, and
                  therefore, the results are still to be determined. However,
                  there is lost opportunity in the offerings of the partnership.
                  The two activities and the limited-edition card, though
                  interesting, could have been more interactive or immersive
                  using an existing <em>Pokémon</em> video game. In 2016,
                  <em>Pokémon</em> developed the massively popular
                  <em>Pokémon GO</em>, an AR game that was accessible on
                  smartphones. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Isaac, 2016</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Isaac, Mike. “Pokémon Go Brings Augmented Reality to a

                  player to capture and train Pokémon with AR. Additionally,
                  there is precedent for a potential addition to the partnership
                  with the Van Gogh Museum. Following the games meteoric rise in
                  popularity, museums included <em>Pokémon GO</em> in their
                  programming and saw a huge increase in their visitation.

                  Though not necessarily a video game centered exhibit,
                  <em>Pokémon GO</em> could have been an interesting addition to
                  the Van Gogh Museum’s educational content. The addition of
                  <em>Pokémon Go</em> would fit the game-based learning elements
                  motivation and engagement. The game is structured around
                  progressing through physical space to attain a goal in
                  conjunction with the location-based technology, it could have
                  leveled up the interaction with the educational content of the
                  cultural and history of the museum. The infrastructure of the
                  AR from <em>Pokémon GO</em> would be an interesting addition
                  for purely educational content. The opportunities with AR to
                  aid in immersive educational experiences are still being
                  explored, including currently at the Metropolitan Museum in
                  New York with <em>Roblox</em>.

                <h3><em>Animal Crossing</em> at the Seattle Aquarium</h3>
                <p>
                  Another example similar to that of <em>Pokémon</em> at Van
                  Gogh is
                  <a href="https://www.seattleaquarium.org/events/animal-crossing-x-seattle-aquarium/" target="_blank"><em>Animal Crossing</em> at the Seattle Aquarium</a>. <em>Animal Crossing</em> is a game series developed by
                  Nintendo. They are life and social simulation games, where
                  players take on the role of a character who moves to a virtual
                  village or island populated by anthropomorphic animals. The
                  aim of the game is for the player to develop and beautify
                  their own village or island by growing fruit and vegetables
                  and to develop friendships with the non-player characters. The
                  most recent <em>Animal Crossing</em> game,
                  <em>New Horizons</em>, came out in March of 2020. With
                  everyone scared and stuck at home during the COVID 19
                  pandemic, <em>Animal Crossing</em> became very popular as a
                  relaxing escape for players. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">MacDonald, 2020</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">MacDonald, Keza. 2020. “‘It’s uniting people’: why 11

                  that the game runs in real-time; the in-game time and seasons
                  mirror those of the real world. Seasonal events, and different
                  fish and insects become available at different times of the
                  day and year, encouraging players to visit regularly and
                  experience the game’s changing world. Interestingly, there is
                  a museum in the game where the players can collect and donate
                  fish, insects, fossils and art to put on display. All the
                  donated specimens and objects are based on real-world ones,
                  and when donated, the in-game curator, an owl named Blathers,
                  will share facts about the donation.

                  The partnership with the Seattle Aquarium runs from October
                  2023-January 2024 and includes photo opportunities with
                  standees of the notable characters, animal facts that are the
                  same as the ones for the in-game museum, and a “bingo
                  scavenger hunt” that visitors can play on a smart device.

                  that are in the game as well as in a selected tank at the
                  aquarium. The scavenger hunt is a good addition to the
                  offerings, allowing for a collaborative element with kids and
                  their grown-ups. There is a potential for the programming to
                  evolve, as the aquarium does promise more activities as it
                  continues.

                  Much like the partnership with <em>Pokémon</em> and Van Gogh,
                  The Seattle Aquarium’s partnership with
                  <em>Animal Crossing</em> is mainly promotional –– to either
                  get fans of the game interested in the aquarium or fans of the
                  aquarium interested in the game. Also like with the
                  partnership with <em>Pokémon</em> and the Van Gogh Museum,
                  there are some lost opportunities.
                  <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizon</em> uses game-based learning
                  strategies in its motivation and engagement as it is a
                  progression of tasks toward a larger goal, while continually
                  learning about the animals that the player catches or objects
                  they collect. The game also uses some elements of adaptivity
                  and graceful failing, as bugs and fish can escape from the
                  player. These game-based learning strategies from the video
                  game would benefit the collaboration. The age range for
                  players in 3-years-old and up, which might account for the
                  simplistic offerings of the partnership. There was the
                  potential to add more content to what was already available in
                  the game. Perhaps even add some virtual or interactive
                  elements for other immersive experiences that might mimic the
                  game play and the game-based learning.
                </p>
                <h2>What Can We Learn?</h2>
                <p>
                  Video games of any kind are a difficult product to produce.
                  Especially with any specificity of subject matter that also
                  meets the standards for successful game-based learning. For
                  both the museum and game-companies, creating a game for a
                  specific location or exhibit is expensive, and takes specific
                  technological understanding. Some museums have made their own
                  video games that engage players either virtually or in the
                  museum’s physical space. For example, the Centre Pompidou in
                  Paris launched their own video game, <em>Prisme 7</em>, in
                  2020. Expanding the definition of museum beyond that of
                  physical space is one of the ways that museums can stay
                  relevant in an increasingly technological world. With the
                  financial and technological help of a recognizable game
                  franchise, there is the possibility of more advanced
                  technologies to be included in museum game-based learning
                  events and exhibits in the future like augmented reality (AR)
                  and virtual reality (VR), or artificial intelligence (AI).
                  These technological advancements might be difficult for
                  museums to achieve by themselves, due to tight budgets and
                  finite resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the visitor, a main limitation is that of accessibility.
                  For many of these partnerships, a device is required in order
                  to engage. This can create a barrier for those museum visitors
                  without access to a smart device, or without the ability to
                  lend one to their children. This excludes lower income
                  visitors, and visitors who are not tech-savvy. These
                  limitations are hard and expensive to overcome, as they do
                  require the museum or game company to provide some sort of
                  interactive technology. There also are drawbacks to immersive
                  technology-based experiences in museums. The increased foot
                  traffic of people who are immersed in their screens rather
                  than the objects in front of them can be a detractor to the
                  experience for people who prefer to enjoy a museum in a
                  traditional way. For families specifically, with an
                  increasingly virtual world, limiting their children’s screen
                  time might also be a priority, and therefore might want to
                  avoid exhibits and museum programs that center around more
                  screens.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  The educational possibilities for game-based learning in
                  museums is ever evolving, especially with the addition of ever
                  evolving technology. Current partnerships with museums and
                  large video game franchises are utilizing those possibilities
                  to varying degrees of success. <em>Roblox</em> and the Met’s
                  development of <em>Replica</em> is a successful case of
                  utilizing game-based learning factors of motivation,
                  engagement, alterability and graceful failure.
                  <em>Pokémon</em> and <em>Animal Crossing</em> had the
                  potential to be educationally engaging as well as promotional.
                  The hope of including game-based learning where a game is
                  integrated into a place of learning, not quite fulfilled with
                  the examples at the Van Gogh Museum and Seattle Aquarium.
                  These two examples and the inclusion of game brand-specific
                  content in the museum could be the first step toward their
                  further integration of major popular media into the museum
                  landscape. However, these kinds of partnerships are also a
                  possible step toward future collaborations where technology
                  and education can create a unique and engaging experience for
                  the visitor.
