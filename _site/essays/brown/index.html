                <h2>In the Beginning</h2>
                <p>
                  Remembering history has been important to humans since the
                  beginning. Pictures were drawn, stories passed down through
                  generations, information written down and stored; all have
                  helped to keep the past accessible in the present, to remember
                  who we are and where we came from. Oral history has been
                  collected for thousands of years. One early account is found
                  in the histories of the Zhou dynasty in China where oral
                  histories had been written down in the courts. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ritchie 2003, 19</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ritchie, Donald A. Doing Oral History: A practical guide.
                      Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003.</span></cite>) Interestingly, in the late 1800s, oral histories were “seen
                  as unscientific and biased” which was the opposite of the
                  desires of the time for researchers of all disciplines to be
                  “as scientific and objective as possible” in their work.

                  through paper archives became a topic of interest for oral
                  history interviewing and recording, despite this opposition.
                  In the 1890s, Native Americans, who had kept most, though not
                  all, of their history through oral tradition were recorded by
                  the U.S. Bureau of Ethnography.

                      Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003.</span></cite>) Oral history only grew after this point in history. During
                  the Great Depression in the United States, the WPA, Works
                  Progress Administration, paid out of work writers to interview
                  and collect information on the lives of ordinary citizens.

                      Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003.</span></cite>) The Columbia Oral History Research office was established
                  in 1948. Nineteen years later in 1967, the Oral History
                  Association was created. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Webster 2016, 256</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Webster, Jessica Wagner. “‘Filling the Gaps’: Oral

                  movement forward, encouraging more interest in oral history
                  interviews. Oral history has been extensively collected from
                  groups since. Post World War II, thousands of oral history
                  interviews were conducted of those who fought in the war and
                  those who survived the horrors of the Holocaust.

                  widely used in the history field, firsthand accounts of events
                  give new insight that a static document cannot provide.

                  Museums also began to take notice of the important role oral
                  history can play in an exhibit. They bring about a unique
                  perspective to the objects and exhibits being displayed. Some
                  museums create incredible oral history inclusions, such as the
                  Anacostia Community Museum’s most recent exhibition, To Live
                  and Breathe: Women and Environmental Justice in Washington,
                  D.C. Others still have a way to go. This essay will argue that
                  the utilization of oral history in museum exhibitions provides
                  a better human connection to the material being exhibited. It
                  will also contend that the practice of oral history is an
                  important way to remember shared histories and personal
                  stories. It should be collected often, on a wide array of
                  topics to remember the realities of human experiences.

                  Understanding what oral history is and how it is gathered is
                  important to the idea of using oral history in a museum
                  exhibit. It is important to note that oral tradition and oral
                  history are two different things, though often conflated with
                  one another. Oral tradition is a practice of passing down
                  history through word of mouth. Anyone can be a participant in
                  this. If a grandmother tells the story of how she met her
                  husband to her children and then they tell their children, and
                  then that story continues to get told to each new generation,
                  the story is kept alive through oral tradition within that
                  family. Oral history is different, and though it is often not
                  stated, this refers to interviews done with another person.
                  The interview aspect is an important part of what oral history
                  is today. A person recounts their life and experiences to
                  someone who is going to record and collect this information
                  for a multitude of uses. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ritchie 2003, 19</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ritchie, Donald A. Doing Oral History: A practical guide.

                  lead to a better understanding of what benefit it would bring
                  to a museum exhibit.

                <h2>Collecting Oral History</h2>
                <p>
                  Though there are no strict requirements on how to collect oral
                  history, the Oral History Association, OHA, gives guidelines
                  on best practices. There is an outline of how to prepare to
                  for interviews, what to do while interviewing, and how to
                  collect and preserve the oral histories one conducts. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Oral History Association 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">OHA. “OHA Principles and Best Practices.” October 2018.

                <p>
                  What makes a good oral history interview? It starts with the
                  preparation. Preparing for the interview with solid questions
                  helps to keep the interviews consistent, making sure the
                  interviewees all have an opportunity to answer each important
                  question. The OHA recommends interviewing the subject in a
                  quiet space and gathering a diverse and relevant group of
                  people to interview. They encourage open-ended discussions and
                  questions that guide the interviewee to provide more context
                  and information, rather than answer just the question asked.
                  The OHA also recommends getting a legal release signed at the
                  time of the interview, preferably at the end. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Oral History Association 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">OHA. “OHA Principles and Best Practices.” October 2018.

                  collection of oral history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My own experiences in collecting oral history do not match up
                  exactly – and I think that is okay. Oral history guidelines
                  help create a uniformed collection. However, that does not
                  mean oral history cannot still be accomplished. As an
                  undergrad student, I did a research project for a class where
                  I found there was a huge gap in information. I had decided to
                  do research on housewives in US history from the 1950s into
                  the present day. I wanted to compare the differences in how
                  their role had changed in the home over time and how society’s
                  perception of them had changed over time. Unfortunately, the
                  kind of information I needed regarding more modern-day
                  examples didn’t really exist. No one had really done any sort
                  of research in this missing area and it was in this moment
                  that I decided to create the information myself. I set out to
                  interview some women in my community to be able to finish my
                  project. I created a specified set of questions to ask them
                  all that I felt would give me an accurate understanding. This
                  early stage of creating oral history was purely for a small
                  subset of my own personal use in a college assignment. I had
                  no formal training, it was right after a pandemic, and I was
                  just hoping to get information I could use in my project. I
                  learned along the way how to better ask the questions to get
                  those I interviewed to tell a story rather than just answer
                  the question and be done. I conducted the interviews wherever
                  the women would meet up with me, so unfortunately, some of
                  them are in a more crowded coffee shop, not exactly the quiet
                  space the OHA recommends. It was not until the semester ended
                  and I turned in my project when I realized that deleting the
                  twenty or so interviews I had spent so much time doing did not
                  feel right. With some guidance by a professor, I decide to
                  reach out to the library on campus to see if they would be
                  interested in housing them as a collection. Researchers could
                  use the information I had gathered in their projects and
                  papers. I reached out to the women I had previously spoken to
                  in order to get a signature allowing me to donate their
                  specific interview to the library and allow others to access
                  them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My experience in collecting oral history wasn’t perfect, there
                  is minimal uniformity. I learned a lot along the way rather
                  than getting information up front. My intended use originally
                  was not for anyone but myself, so I didn’t follow the exact
                  OHA guidelines. Even still, I believe these interviews could
                  be of use to someone in the future, or educational, or
                  interesting and felt that they would be better served to the
                  public than just sitting on my computer forever. That is one
                  of the wonderful things about oral history interviews, even an
                  interview done for class can have a life larger than the
                  assignment it was originally intended for.

                <h2>What Makes Oral History so Special?</h2>
                <p>
                  What is so fascinating about oral history, is that anyone who
                  listens is able to hear about an experience from the mouth of
                  someone who lived it. Listeners can know exactly the tone of
                  voice that was used to tell the story, they can hear the
                  inflection on certain words and how they might change the
                  meaning. If the interview is video recorded, a viewer can
                  witness the emotion in the eyes of the speaker. They can see a
                  person has aged if they are telling stories from a time
                  before. Almost in a way, verifying that this person truly
                  lived in the past. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">de Jong 2018, 115</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">de Jong, Steffi. “Exhibiting: The Witness to History as a

                  Museums as institutions set out to tell stories, to bring
                  history into the present and inform those that step inside.
                  Using oral history to tell the stories, direct from the mouths
                  of those who experienced them, seems like an incredible way to
                  utilize a collection of history. Collecting oral history
                  allows stories that might never be told to get added to the
                  history books. People who could not read or write, who did not
                  have access to higher education were able to bring their
                  stories to the world through oral history interviews. Oral
                  history interviewing has been a tool that allows minorities of
                  all kinds, all over the world, to tell their stories when they
                  might not have been recorded otherwise. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ritchie 2003, 13,23</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ritchie, Donald A.

                      Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003.</span></cite>) Not only do minorities get a voice, but those who are
                  silenced by an ‘official’ narrative can refute and tell the
                  truth, like those living in the Soviet Union after its
                  collapse. Oral historians from Russia and Eastern Europe
                  became incredibly interested in interviewing regular people.
                  They reviewed and compared the ‘official’ narratives given by
                  the totalitarian regime and those given by the people who
                  lived in the former Soviet Union. When comparing the two, it
                  was easy to find holes and lies in the ‘official’ narrative
                  when so many regular people were giving a story that differed
                  from the government but matched other citizens.

                <h2>If it is so Special, What is the Problem?</h2>
                <p>
                  If oral history interviews are unique, bring human connection,
                  and help to tell a compelling story —what’s the problem? The
                  issue that lies within using oral history inside museums is
                  not so much an issue of access or a lack of material, but more
                  so it can be an issue with the space itself. How does a
                  curator or an exhibit designer put oral history into the
                  exhibit and make it a good addition? Sarah Zenaida Gould, a
                  curator from Texas, discusses some of her challenges in adding
                  oral history into her exhibitions. Managing the sound from
                  videos is one of the big ones. Trying not to overwhelm
                  visitors with too much sound stimulation is something curators
                  need to be cognizant of when putting together an exhibit. For
                  Gould, a solution was to use a ‘sound wand’ that visitors
                  could pick up to listen to the oral history. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Gould 2016</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Gould, Sarah Zenaida. “Challenges in exhibiting Oral

                  visitors did not stop to listen and she does not quite know
                  the reason. Too long? Missed it completely? Any number of
                  reasons could have kept visitors from engaging with the oral
                  interviews. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Gould 2016</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Gould, Sarah Zenaida. “Challenges in exhibiting Oral

                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the biggest issues that comes with displaying and
                  elevating oral history in a museum exhibit is there is no one
                  right way to do it. There is no formulaic way to display them,
                  to deal with the sound, to make them eye-catching enough to
                  grab the attention of a visitor, but not so long they walk
                  away before it is over. However, even without a formula to
                  display oral history, there are good processes utilized by
                  exhibit designers when it comes to sound in museums.
                  Understanding sound, even at a basic level, can help designers
                  and curators create a more cohesive space that does not
                  overwhelm the visitor. Types of sound can be placed into two
                  basic categories: diegetic and non-diegetic. Diegetic sound is
                  normally things like “audiovisual presentations, interactive
                  stations, and other content-driven musical/soundscape
                  installations,” or, things put in the foreground of an
                  exhibit. While non-diegetic sound is most often things that
                  appear naturally in the background; the scuffing of shoes,
                  kids laughing, background music can also be considered
                  non-diegetic. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Everett 2019, 314</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Everett, Tom. “A Curatorial Guide to Museum Sound

                      Web.</span></cite>) For a designer, understanding these categories of sound can
                  come in hand when creating an oral history exhibition. Taking
                  into account both the intentional and background sound that
                  will exist can help create a display of oral history that does
                  not completely overwhelm the visitor’s senses. Nikos Bubaris
                  makes a great point when discussing the stereotypes that come
                  with museums and their influence on exhibitions. For so long,
                  the idea that museums are places of silent reflection has been
                  a pervasive idea for those visiting and working in museums.
                  Bubaris makes note that, believing a public space should be
                  silent makes sound a big issue from the outset of designing
                  the exhibit. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Bubaris 2014, 391</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Bubaris, Nikos. “Sound in Museums - Museums in Sound.”

                      391-402. Web.</span></cite>) How is there supposed to be a good balance between the
                  diegetic and non-diegetic sounds in the museum if it is
                  believed by both workers and visitors that any background
                  noise should not exist? As museums shift to being a more sound
                  inclusive space, a push toward the idea that sound is present
                  and welcome in museums, oral history might find an easier path
                  into museums that might previously have shied away from the

                  Gould discusses an exhibit that came to be without the use of
                  video and audio, but rather the oral history interviews were
                  transcribed and written on panels throughout the space. A
                  great question Gould asks, “Could it be that video is easier
                  to ignore than the written word?” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Gould 2016</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Gould, Sarah Zenaida. “Challenges in exhibiting Oral
                      History.” OUPblog. March 4, 2016.
                      <a href="https://blog.oup.com/2016/03/exhibiting-oral-history/" target="_blank">https://blog.oup.com/2016/03/exhibiting-oral-history/</a>.</span></cite>) In this modern age, sounds are around us constantly. Music
                  in the background at stores and restaurants, or video on while
                  scrolling on phones. It can be easy to miss a video or audio
                  portion of an exhibit when so often a person is already
                  surrounded my pre-recorded noises. This issue that arises when
                  displaying oral history should not dissuade curators from
                  utilizing oral history within their exhibits. It should
                  encourage them to think outside what has already been tried,
                  what has already not worked out. The beauty of oral history
                  comes from its unique abilities to share personal stories,
                  firsthand accounts from those who lived the experience an
                  exhibit is trying to display. Excluding oral history from
                  exhibitions purely because it is challenging is not good
                  practice, curators display challenging history and ideas
                  constantly, this should not be the exception.

                  Oral History in Use Today: The Anacostia Community Museum
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The Anacostia Community Museum in Washington, D.C. is an
                  example of utilizing oral history inside an exhibition in a
                  meaningful way. The museum’s curator, Rachel Seidman, created
                  an exhibit about women and environmental justice in
                  Washington, D.C. and does a beautiful job of getting real
                  stories from community members and including them in the
                  exhibit. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Anacostia 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Anacostia Community Museum. “To Live and Breathe: Women
                      and Environmental Justice in Washington, D.C.” Accessed
                      October 30, 2023.
                      <a href="https://anacostia.si.edu/liveandbreathe" target="_blank">https://anacostia.si.edu/liveandbreathe</a>.</span></cite>) There are quotes on the walls, pictures and videos that
                  correlate. At the Anacostia Community Museum, the objects have
                  obvious stories, they have obvious significance. There is a
                  pair of boots from a woman who works in aquaculture, a male
                  dominated industry. Her boots, along with a quote from an oral
                  history interview next to the boots, gives them a tangible
                  meaning to those visiting. Her voice telling the story is what
                  makes the object so special. Oral history is a connection to a
                  story straight from the source. Rather than just get
                  information on how women are impacted by these environmental
                  injustices, we as visitors, see exactly how it impacts real
                  people. It is no longer an idea, but a reality that we see in
                  the lives of those showcased in the exhibit. The fishing boot
                  is just a boot in a case without the history, the story,
                  behind them. The Anacostia Community Museum took real stories
                  and included them in the exhibition. While visiting the
                  museum, Seidman discussed with my group the importance of
                  connection when working with oral history in communities. The
                  women’s stories she told in the exhibit are a vitally
                  important part in telling the story of environmental injustice
                  in DC, the whole concept of the exhibit. The same can be said
                  for oral history inside other exhibits. The information that
                  can be learned from an oral history interview can create an
                  exhibit all on its own. Even still, utilizing oral history in
                  combination with an existing idea can bring about a new level
                  on connection. Real people, real stories, can put visitors
                  that much closer to understanding and caring about the exhibit
                  they visited. The Anacostia Community Museum does an amazing
                  job when it comes to including oral history. Knowing that it
                  is possible is an encouragement to all curators that oral
                  history can work in exhibit space and be intriguing in exhibit
                  space.

                <p>
                  Steffi de Jong writes about a man, Kurt Tucholsky, visiting
                  the First World War Museum and feeling that it was missing the
                  realities of the war. There were just recreations, pictures
                  and posters, improvised shoes made out of newspapers inside
                  the museum; nothing that spoke to the horrors of war, nothing
                  that brought any emotion into the equation. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">de Jong 2018, 110</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">de Jong, Steffi. “Exhibiting: The Witness to History as a
                      Museum Object.” In The Witness as Object: Video
                      Testimonies in Holocaust Museums, 110-80. Berghahn Books,
                      2018.

                  inadequate in telling the real story. An object is just
                  another object without a story behind it. Today, museums
                  utilize the story behind objects in many exhibitions. They
                  give reference to an example of when an old object might have
                  been used. Or they recreate the style of clothing that may
                  have been worn during a specific time period. Utilizing oral
                  histories can give views a true experience in which an object
                  was used. A camera that ‘may have been used during this war’
                  is interesting to many on its own because it is old and from a
                  different time. But seeing that a camera was used by a soldier
                  during a war and captured images of the conflict might bring
                  about a more solid, human connection to the object. As stated
                  previously, objects do not really mean much without a human
                  connection to them. Oral history can provide an incredible
                  story to an object. But that is not all oral history can do.
                  Oral history in itself is a great resource for museums.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The use of oral history in museums has taken a course that
                  leads visitors to a better understanding of real human
                  experience when they step inside the exhibit. It is being
                  utilized in museums in new and interesting ways. It is getting
                  collected by many different oral historians. It is getting
                  collected from varied groups on various topics. With so much
                  oral history being collected and museums already utilizing it
                  in the exhibitions, museums are well on their way to making
                  oral history exhibitions a staple of museums. As the field
                  progresses to be more sound inclusive, oral history audio and
                  video recordings shift from being too loud or distracting to
                  an integral part of the sound landscape. The increase in
                  collecting oral history allows for both historical and more
                  contemporary first-hand accounts of experiences being
                  presented in museums. With incredible examples like the
                  Anacostia Community Museum to lead the way and visitors like
                  me, that see a human connection to the material through oral
                  history as something intriguing and engaging, oral history
                  exhibits are sure to be popping up more in the near future.
