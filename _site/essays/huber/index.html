                  Video games have gone from a small niche in the entertainment
                  sector to a cultural mainstay alongside film and literature in
                  just a few decades. For the purpose of this paper video games
                  include arcade games with their own standalone cabinets, games
                  played on both at home consoles and personal computers, and
                  mobile games played on the phone. In 2021, the video game
                  industry had an annual revenue of over 214 billion dollars, a
                  number that is predicted to continue to rise in coming years.

                  world cannot be ignored or denied. Given this significance, it
                  makes sense that video games would be represented in museums.
                  They also can unlock new opportunities for engagement and
                  outreach that would have been out of reach without the
                  influence of video games. Different museums approach having
                  video games in their collection in a variety of ways,
                  <em>The Museum of Modern Art</em> (<em>MOMA</em>) incorporates
                  them into their galleries, while the
                  <em>Coputerspielemuseum</em> and the
                  <em>Strong Museum of Play</em> have recreated arcades or other
                  themed spaces for some of the games that they have on display.
                  The approaches vary based on the hardware and requirements of
                  the game themselves, as well as what the museums are trying to
                  convey by displaying them and how interactive they want them
                  to be.

                  Video games have value in museums in multiple respects. One of
                  the things that make video games stand out from other artistic
                  mediums is their inherent interactivity. Video games are meant
                  to be played;, they take the player and make them a part of
                  the story. Because of this, in order toto be best represented
                  in a museum, video games should be playable to some degree.
                  Video games are meant to be played, they bring people in on
                  the experience and make their choices matter. While museums
                  have made strides in increasing interactives in exhibits and
                  museum programming, the fact that video games are made to be
                  interacted with encourages further engagement from visitors.
                  When interviewed about the museum’s Video Game Lab as Video
                  Game Curator for the
                  <em>Australian Center for the Moving Image</em>, Video Game
                  Curator Arieh Offman, said describes, “And it is this
                  interactivity that is the crux of what makes games so
                  appealing – you are not just watching or listening to stories
                  but become part of them. You control the characters, you make
                  the choices –they become your victories and your defeats, and
                  the sense of achievement that a player feel is unique to the
                  medium of videogames.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">ACMI 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Curating Our Centrepiece Exhibition. ACMI. Accessed

                  stand out from other forms of media. However, there are
                  complications in having playable video games as a part of a
                  museum collection, because of hardware and software
                  limitations. Every playable game requires its own console or
                  other device to be run on, in addition to controllers,
                  displays, and of course copies of the game’s code. Museums
                  would either need to limit the number of visitors who can
                  participate at once, acquire multiple copies of the necessary
                  hardware and software, or engage with emulators. The Museum of
                  Modern Art has a variety of video games in its collection,
                  ranging from staples of the industry like <em>Pac Man</em>, to
                  independently made games like <em>Getting Over It</em>.

                  for any games that they acquire in their original language so
                  that they can be better preserved, even if the physical media
                  fails, or if the game, console, or controller is too fragile
                  to be interacted with regularly by visitors. They also use a
                  case-by-case basis for how interactive they have the games on
                  display be. Games that can be played in their entirety in a
                  short time are available to be played as is, while longer or
                  more complex games have smaller sections able to be played

                  media on which the game is stored is too fragile to be used.

                  In addition to MOMA, there are other museums that have already
                  integrated video games as a part of their exhibitions, and in
                  some cases are in large part dedicated to collecting and
                  exhibiting video games and related media. One of the museums

                  their exhibits allow visitors to interact with and play some

                  the exhibit has several reconstructed spaces showing how video
                  games of different eras were played at the time. These include
                  a recreated arcade and living room to represent the 1970s,
                  when games first started to appear in homes, and bedrooms for
                  the 1980s and 1990s. The goal of this exhibit is for visitors
                  to see the development of video games over time, and how they

                  One of these is a permanent exhibit dedicated to the game
                  series <em>Age of Empires</em>, a game series for the PC that
                  falls under the category of RTS, or real time strategy. The
                  game has players select an empire from various points in
                  history and compete against another set of empires controlled
                  by other players, or the computer. Players must build up an
                  economy to unlock new technologies, create a powerful
                  military, and defeat their opponents. There have been four
                  games in the main franchise, with one spinoff titled
                  <em>Age of Mythology</em>. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Age of Empires 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Age of Empires Franchise - Official Web Site.” Age of

                  get a look at how it was made and what choices went into those
                  decisions. While most other exhibits dedicated to games seem
                  more focused on broader categories of games, the
                  <em>Age of Empires</em> exhibit is an excellent example of how
                  to highlight the development and story of one game franchise
                  in particular.

                  <em>EGame Revolution</em>, which focuses on having video games
                  from every generation to play though. This includes a large
                  arcade space with over 48 arcade cabinet style games, home
                  consoles with playable games ranging from Nintendo’s
                  <em>N64</em> to <em>Sony’s PlayStation 3</em>, as well as

                  <em>eGame Revolution</em>, the <em>Strong Museum</em> also has
                  a large collection of video games in storage. As with any
                  museum, only a small portion of their collection can be on
                  display at a time, and the <em>Strong Museum</em> is not
                  solely dedicated to video games, so that collection can only
                  take up a certain amount of space on the museum floor. But
                  this collection still serves as a valuable academic resource,

                  Older video games are a storage and preservation concern for
                  museums collecting video games. Floppy disks, which contain
                  may older PC games, have an expected shelf life of 10-20
                  years, and CDs and DVDs, which were the main medium for PC and
                  console games following the floppy disk era, have a listed
                  life span of between 2-25 years depending on how they are

                  physical hardware, it also applies to digital colonies of
                  games and their marketplaces. Many consoles have their own
                  digital stores that have gone through multiple iterations,
                  removing older games as they go. Meanwhile PC games are sold
                  across multiple marketplaces, leaving more room for
                  redundancy, but there are still cases where games are lost,
                  and only those that exist on a hard drive or disk somewhere
                  remain. These losses can be accidental, with updated versions
                  not being supported or a developer going under and no longer
                  being able to sell the game, or intentional, as there are
                  cases where for various reasons, developers have intentionally
                  made games unavailable after their release.

                  One of the most famous examples of a video game being
                  intentionally removed from all digital marketplaces was a
                  game, or trailer for a game, called *P.T.*This game was
                  actually a trailer for a game that was never released, the
                  name was an abbreviation of Playable Trailer. It was set to be
                  the next installment in the <em>Silent Hill</em> franchise of
                  horror games. The trailer consisted of a player walking
                  through the same house in a loop. As the loop went on, the
                  house got more decrepit, and more noises and scary imagery was
                  put in until eventually a ghost would appear and kill the
                  player. The game was set to have big names attached, at the
                  end of <em>P.T.</em> It is revealed that the character the
                  player controls is based on Norman Reedus, an actor famous for
                  his role on The Walking Dead. Hideo Kojima, a famous game
                  developer, and the director Guillermo Del Toro were also set
                  to work on the game. Unfortunately, Kojima had a falling out
                  with the developer <em>Konami,</em> the game was cancelled,
                  and <em>P.T.</em> was removed from all online game stores.

                  on it, and the excitement of a new installment of a fan
                  favorite franchise like <em>Silent Hill,</em> but also because
                  it was unique. Although game demos were not a new idea,
                  <em>P.T.</em> was made and presented in a different way. Most
                  demos were a level or two pulled from the game, but
                  <em>P.T.</em> was as its name described, a trailer; it was its
                  own self-contained content that just hinted at the story of
                  the now lost <em>Silent Hills</em> –– a fully interactive hook
                  to get people to want more. The trailer made the player a part
                  of the story before the game was even out. The case of
                  <em>P.T.</em> reflects why it is so important to preserve the
                  interactive aspect of video games in museums, and how
                  essential it is to fully engage with them.

                  Museums that display video games and have them available for
                  interaction by visitors have different methods of access and
                  what versions are displayed. Some museums, like
                  <em>MOMA</em> not only do things on a case-by-case basis, but
                  also create a smaller build or one manufactured to recreate a
                  massive multiplayer environment, as they did with
                  <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>.

                  when it comes to home console and PC games, there are other
                  issues encountered. As original hardware fails, having games,
                  especially older or rare ones on display for public use
                  greatly increases the risk that they can be lost forever.
                  Emulation is one method to ensure that the game can be
                  preserved or displayed beyond its original hardware, but it is
                  frowned upon by the gaming industry. There have not been any
                  legal cases regarding creation of emulators of games that are
                  owned by the creator, but when it comes to the distribution of
                  emulated games, especially online, charges of piracy come into
                  play. Museums collecting video games are able to create
                  emulations and recreations of games they own, though they can
                  also work with developers to do this, but they cannot make
                  them available online. This differs somewhat from the trend of
                  digitization across the museum world, but where a painting or
                  other form of more traditional art can have the rights
                  regarding its online publication transferred to a museum when
                  it is donated, unless a game is donated by a developer and
                  consents, the same cannot be done for video games. This makes
                  the <em>Strong Museum’s</em> collection’s availability for
                  research access even more valuable.

                  Video games are an extremely varied medium that has expanded
                  from a small niche in entertainment to a mainstay, a
                  multibillion-dollar industry with countless titles released
                  every single year. It is understandable that video games have
                  an established presence in museums, from museums dedicated to
                  video games to larger institutions that acquire them as a part
                  of their collections. The innate interactivity of video games
                  creates challenges and opportunities for their display. By
                  design, video games draw the viewer, the player, in, and make
                  them a part of the art and the story being told. They draw
                  visitors in for an utterly unique experience. They also can be
                  used to make unique art installations based around the games,
                  from oversized games that require cooperation, or something
                  totally new like <em>Coputerspielemuseum’s</em>
                  <em>Pain Station</em>.

                  challenges in regard to preservation. Many older games are
                  long past their expected shelf life and having them available
                  for play puts them at increased risk of damage. Emulation is
                  one method of further preserving and increasing availability
                  of video game collections. As video games continue to be a
                  part of museum collections, they will be used in new and
                  interesting ways of expanding interactivity, and new solutions
                  for preservation will be developed.
