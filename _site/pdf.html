                  This publication was created by students in the fall 2023
                  <em>Museums and Technology</em> course at George Washington
                  University. It is the fourth iteration of this project, which
                  sees graduate students grappling with the implications of
                  digital technologies for museums.

                  <a href="#page-https-corcoran-gwu-edu-museum-studies" target="_blank"><em>Master of Arts in Museum Studies</em></a>
                  program at George Washington University responds to the
                  evolving museum profession by combining hands-on training with
                  future-focused theoretical engagement. Students who enrol in
                  the program gain foundational knowledge about the state of
                  museum work today, practical skills and the ability to
                  critically engage with developments in the field.

                <p>
                  In <em>Museums and Technology</em>, we take on an ambitious
                  project to realize these goals. Across the 14-week semester,
                  the class creates a publication about the state of digital
                  practice in museums in 2023. Each student is responsible for
                  creating a publishable piece that explores a specific research
                  area related to the overall topic of museums and technology.
                  Submissions can synthesize current readings and practice
                  around a broad area, or dive deeper into a single technology
                  or case study related to the theme of digital practice and its
                  impact on the museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is the fourth iteration of this publication project. The
                  <a href="#page-https-ad-hoc-museum-collective-github-io-gwu-museum-digital-practice-2019" target="_blank">first</a>, produced in 2019, was designed by Dr Suse Anderson, and
                  informed by her experience co-editing several
                  digitally-informed publishing projects, including
                  <a href="#page-https-medium-com-code-words-technology-and-theory-in-the-museum" target="_blank"><em>CODE|WORDS Technology and Theory in the Museum</em></a>, which brought together leading museum thinkers and
                  practitioners to explore the impact of digital technology on
                  the nature of museums, and
                  <a href="#page-https-ad-hoc-museum-collective-github-io-humanizing-the-digital" target="_blank"><em>Humanizing the Digital: Unproceedings from the 2018 MCN
                      Confererence</em></a>, which responded to the
                  <a href="#page-http-mcn-edu" target="_blank"><em>MCN annual conference</em></a>. Each of these museum tech projects marked a specific moment
                  in time within the sector. Likewise, it is intended that each
                  annual publication in the
                  <em>The State of Museum Digital Practice</em> series will
                  stand as a marker of each cohort of students and their
                  concerns and interests in a specific timeframe.

                <p>
                  The first two versions of this publication (produced in
                  <a href="#page-https-ad-hoc-museum-collective-github-io-gwu-museum-digital-practice-2019" target="_blank">2019</a>
                  and
                  <a href="#page-https-ad-hoc-museum-collective-github-io-museum-digital-practice-2021" target="_blank">2021</a>) buttressed the global coronavirus pandemic, with its huge
                  disruptions to museum practice, education and daily life. The
                  <a href="#page-https-gwu-museum-studies-github-io-museum-digital-practice-2022" target="_blank">2022 publication</a>
                  came from a world still in the earliest grapplings with the
                  implications of the pandemic, but already showing signs of
                  concern with different kinds of issues, and new possible
                  futures for museums in their relationships with technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2023, we find students starting to consider new kinds of
                  emerging technologies… Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has
                  started to appear as a player in the imaginations of several
                  students as they think about the present and future of digital
                  technologies in museums, including considering the role of AI
                  in provenance research or meditating on the ethical
                  considerations of AI-enabled historic storytelling. Others
                  imagine a possible future where volumetric holograms play a
                  role in historic landscape reconstruction or where 3D digital
                  exhibitions fill a kind of nostalgic craving in those looking
                  for a lost past. As a group, this cohort is ambitious,
                  creative and speculative, asking many of the same kinds of
                  questions of technology as prior generations, but set against
                  within a changing techscape.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each student is responsible for defining and researching their
                  topic and writing their paper. Suse Anderson, Associate
                  Professor in Museum Studies is responsible for compiling the
                  final book. Because the project is produced quickly, the
                  editorial hand is only lightly felt, so there may be
                  inconsistencies in style, formatting and approach.
                </p>

                  We hope you enjoy this publication, produced by the fall class
                  of 2023.

                  When interpreting historic sites and ruins, a lot of trust is
                  placed in the imagination of the visitor. A docent may
                  describe the rolling fields of a plantation with communities
                  of slave houses dotting the landscape, or the remainder of a
                  Greek temple which has long since been destroyed; but
                  ultimately their description only provides an outline, and
                  they can only hope they have provided enough detail that the
                  visitor can mentally paint in the rest of the picture.
                  Reconstructions can eliminate this subjectivity, but are
                  costly, and run the risk of damaging the historic resources
                  they are trying to aid. Artistic depictions provide detail,
                  but cannot be overlain on the landscape, resulting in visitors
                  having to look back and forth between location and signage,
                  breaking their immersion in the space. But picture, if with
                  the press of a button a structure could appear, the gaps on a
                  temple would be filled in, and a full landscape could be seen
                  in context. That without relying on disparate imaginations a
                  museum could temporarily display a reconstruction, without
                  jeopardizing the existing features above or below ground. And
                  being able to show all of this not to one person at a time
                  with the use of goggles or screens, but to a crowd, who can
                  examine and analyze together. The possibilities for
                  interpretation, collaboration, and understanding could grow
                  exponentially with the use of one developing technology. I am
                  speaking, of course, of holograms.

                <h2>Misconceptions, Preconceptions, and Definitions</h2>
                <p>
                  To start, we should define our subject. Far from being a
                  technological marvel, humanity has had “holograms” for nearly
                  eight decades now. While science fiction calls to mind images
                  of Princess Leia being projected by R2-D2 in 1977’s
                  <em>Star Wars</em>, (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Lucas 1977</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Lucas, George, dir. <em>Star Wars: A New Hope</em>. 1977;
                      Beverly Hills, CA: 20th Century Fox.</span></cite>) the reality is much more mundane. In 1971, Dennis Gabor won
                  a Nobel Peace prize for his 1947 work utilizing the
                  interference of light waves to print a three-dimensional image
                  on a two dimensional surface,(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Nobel Prize 1971</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">NobelPrize.org. “The Nobel Prize in Physics 1971.”

                  awe today, his hologram images birthed the technical
                  definition of “a three-dimensional image formed by
                  interference of light beams from a laser or other coherent
                  light source.”(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Oxford Languages</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Oxford English Dictionary via Oxford Languages, s.v.

                  University of Michigan, Emmet Leith and Juris Upatnieks, who
                  were able to produce a three-dimensional image of a model

                  more definite description is needed.

                  The International Hologram Manufacturers Association lamented
                  this definition issue at their annual forum in 2019,
                  commenting that the advent of augmented reality (AR), virtual
                  reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR) have further complicated
                  hologram terminology, with all four terms being used
                  interchangeably by different researchers for increasingly
                  similar technologies. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Deakes 2019</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Deakes, Mark. “The Changing Meaning of the Word

                  display a three-dimensional image to the viewer, but do not
                  meet the threshold of “a three-dimensional image formed by
                  interference of light beams from a laser or other coherent
                  light source.”(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Encyclopedia Britannica 1972</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden=""><em>Introduction to Holography</em>. Encyclopedia

                  Gabor, Leith, and Upatnieks’ work, adding that the resulting
                  image must be able to be seen “without any special equipment,
                  such as cameras or glasses.”(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Byers 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Byers, Kirsty. “The Importance of Holograms and How They

                  virtual reality, and mixed reality viewers it still covers a
                  huge amount of two-dimensional images, and does not
                  necessarily describe our ideal set out in science fiction.

                  Volumetric Hologram.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Blundell 2011</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Blundell, Barry. About 3D Volumetric Displays. Auckland,

                  inherent three-dimensional presentation of all holograms, into
                  something with the actual presence of height, width, and
                  depth, and not just the illusory appearance of it.
                  Furthermore, this volumetric display, to match our science
                  fiction ideal, should be able to be projected into free space,
                  rather than onto a screen or an enclosure. As such, throughout
                  this research the term “volumetric hologram” will be utilized,
                  as it appears to be the semantic middle ground between popular
                  understanding and scientific research.

                <h2>Overcoming the Laws of Light</h2>
                <p>
                  At present volumetric hologram technology is still science
                  fiction, foiled by real-world physics and the scientific
                  properties of light, however, ingenious solutions are being
                  developed by artists and engineers worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The greatest obstacle to a truly freestanding volumetric
                  hologram lies in an issue with the most basic principle of how
                  light works. For most wavelengths of light to be seen by the
                  naked eye, they have to bounce off something. Open air
                  provides little for light to bounce off of. This inherent
                  fault has led to the development of the “faux” holograms
                  discussed earlier, either through augmented reality, virtual
                  reality, or through more traditional methods such as
                  projection onto a screen. However, these are merely illusions
                  of three-dimensional space, with no actual volume. As such,
                  three potential solutions have been developed to overcome this
                  fundamental law of light: water, gas, and plasma.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The water and gas solutions are operationally different, but
                  create similar results. In these methods, a fine mist of water
                  or concentration of gas is released into an area where the
                  volumetric hologram is to be displayed, providing an
                  invisible, multidimensional surface for light to bounce off at
                  different points and vectors. French artist Joanie Lemercier
                  has been pioneering the water method, creating interactive
                  projections in mist.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Mashable Deals 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Mashable Deals. “Closest Thing We Have to Holograms Right

                  phases, and work better as a proof of concept than as
                  actionable technology. Gas has been utilized as a medium
                  primarily in scientific laboratories, but has been successful
                  in producing a small, but fully volumetric, hologram.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Gu 2004</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Gu, Yuhan, Shigang Wan, Qing Liu, and Changqing Ye.

                  they must also manage the natural state of those variables.
                  Gas, by its nature, matches the shape and volume of whatever
                  container it is in. As such, this method is only possible for
                  enclosed spaces, and with such concentrations required for the
                  display that it is unlikely humans would be able to enter
                  them. It’s perfectly functional for small scale volumetric
                  holograms, but an impossible option when discussing large or
                  outdoor displays. Furthermore, in the context of historic
                  sites and ruins, fine mists of water or particulates begin to
                  risk preservation concerns to the exposed historic features,
                  and should be approached with care.

                  So, how do you project without a screen or particulate to
                  project onto? The plasma method from Japanese firm Aerial
                  Burton offers another solution to this issue, developing a
                  system to project images directly into the air.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Edwards 2014</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Edwards, Luke. “Holograms Are Finally Here: Plasma Lasers

                  utilized. This is accomplished via an ultra-precise pulse
                  laser ionizing specific air particles to create small plasma
                  bursts. These bursts only last a nanosecond, but the resulting
                  points of light form the boundaries of a shape, freely
                  floating in midair. While this technology is by no means
                  perfect, it is a consequential first step towards the

                <p>
                  Still then, lies the question of the potential applications of
                  these volumetric holograms. Two-dimensional projection
                  holograms have already been established in museums around the
                  world, almost exclusively in small, indoor exhibits. The 19th
                  century Pepper’s Ghost Effect (Figure 2), popularized by theme
                  park attractions such as Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion, has
                  been increasingly utilized in museums to display animals or
                  people inside of exhibit cases, interacting with collections
                  objects without actually touching them (Figure 3).(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">HOLOCO 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">HOLOCO GmbH. “3D Hologram for Museum,” November 8, 2022.

                  In a showing of the possibilities of the technology, the
                  Illinois Holocaust Museum has integrated projection holograms
                  as critical to the learning experience; the museum has
                  recorded hundreds of hours of stories of Holocaust survivors
                  as digital holograms, allowing visitors to interact, listen,
                  and ask questions of them as though they were present in the

                  What becomes possible with volumetric holograms is the
                  large-scale interpretation of historic landscapes. Landscape
                  interpretation always takes a measure of creative
                  interpretation for museums and historic sites, especially in
                  cases where the historic features are no longer standing.
                  Ruins themselves tell a story, but interpretive narratives are
                  limited when the full scale of a historic scene is absent from
                  view. Descriptions or photographs encourage visitors to use
                  their imaginations to envision long absent vistas or the
                  former grandeur of an estate, but a barren landscape stands
                  antithetical to this view. Reconstructions are costly, run the
                  risk of damaging the remaining ruins or subsurface features of
                  a site, and they cannot be changed after being built, meaning
                  the later discovery of any inaccuracies cannot be addressed.
                  While virtual reality provides some answers to these issues,
                  the virtual reconstruction of the world the viewer enters into
                  inherently separates them from the historical landscape and
                  features they are standing amidst. Augmented reality works to
                  bridge this gap, but still separates the viewer from the
                  subject through goggles or a handheld screen. What volumetric
                  holograms might provide , that these other technologies do
                  not, is the ability to project into space the form of a
                  structure, or missing parts of a ruin, and have that visible
                  in real time as an extension of the landscape around the
                  viewer, rather than replacing it.

                  So far, we’ve mainly seen the replication of small objects
                  inside of exhibits, as in the examples discussed above, but
                  imagine how much more could be done with a change in scale.
                  With volumetric holograms, ruined structures, buildings,
                  churches, and so on could be displayed at their full form, not
                  just as the remains currently extant. Historic houses,
                  befallen to fire or neglect, could have gaps filled in to give
                  an impression of the peak of their use. Ancient ruins of
                  structures or cities could be visible in their original
                  context, with spatial relationships and construction able to
                  be analyzed and interpreted relative to not only each other
                  but the landscape around it. Further extrapolating, entire
                  landscapes could benefit, visualizing slave structures on
                  historic plantations or fortification locations on
                  battlefields. Locations where archaeology, oral history, or
                  archival records identify that cultural resources lie could be
                  rebuilt without ever impacting the subsurface, or even making
                  a permanent change.

                  Large-scale holograms for landscape interpretation have a
                  variety of inherent drawbacks, even in their conceptual state.
                  To be worthwhile for museums, the ideal technology would
                  involve what the American Alliance of Museums has dubbed
                  “frictionless” technology:(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Davis 2020</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Davis, Matt. “Towards Frictionless Augmented Reality,”

                  can see without the use of assistive devices, and which they
                  can move around to examine at different angles. The technology
                  should be simple for museum staff to operate and maintain with
                  basic training, and without the help of an outside specialist,
                  ideally with something as simple as pressing a button or
                  running a software program. The machine hardware itself should
                  be built to survive outdoor environments, or have critical
                  components easily removable to protect from weather and theft.
                  For the purposes of this research, this will be the
                  established ideal, so as to limit the infinite possibilities
                  of technological advancement.

                  As the foundation of this entire concept revolves around
                  manipulation of light, immediately we must discuss what we’re
                  competing with; namely, the sun. Because research on
                  volumetric holograms is still ongoing, their ability to
                  project during daytime is largely speculation. The heated
                  plasma technology from Aerial Burton is shown working in
                  daylight,(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Aerial Burton 2014</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden=""><em>Aerial Burton 3D Display Projects Images into

                  earlier have almost universally been shown in darkened rooms
                  or after sunset. The limitations of the technology are largely
                  going to be based on which system is adopted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For museums, volumetric holograms which can be displayed in
                  the daylight are ideal, as it allows connection with the
                  largest number of visitors with the smallest inconvenience to
                  current operations. Those that can only be displayed at night
                  are limiting. In many public museums, this is outside of
                  normal opening hours, and would restrict viewing of any
                  reconstructions to special events or selected evenings. This
                  results in a familiar cost-benefit analysis for the museum; is
                  the cost of the technology offset by the public interest and
                  benefit to the museum’s mission? Luckily, there is precedent
                  for exactly this scenario.

                  projection mapping.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Viaggio nei fori 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Viaggio nei fori. “Viaggio Nei Fori 2022,” YouTube, June

                  have been fully projection mapped to exhibit the rich painted
                  colors, elaborate sculptures, and intricate tiled floors which
                  would have been familiar to a citizen of Ancient Rome. (Figure
                  5) This is viewed by the audience in real time without the use
                  of assistive technology other than headphones for the docent’s
                  audio tour. The tour, “Viaggio Nei Fori” (Journey through the
                  Fora) was offered nightly throughout the summers of 2015-2022,
                  and, while attendance numbers are not publicly available, the
                  online reviews and seven-year-long run suggest it was
                  popular.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Trip Advisor</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Viaggio Nei Fori - All You Need to Know BEFORE You Go

                  volumetric hologram, the intentions and functionality are
                  similar. And, despite the required night hours, visitors
                  appear to have enjoyed the uniqueness of the display, and many
                  recommended it as a “must see” when visiting Rome.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Trip Advisor</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Viaggio Nei Fori - All You Need to Know BEFORE You Go

                  Now, it stands to reason that in light of this success,
                  projection mapping should be considered as the next great
                  frontier for museums. This is already well underway. Many
                  exhibits are already implementing projection mapping as an
                  integral part of their displays, including teamLab in Japan
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">teamLab</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“teamLab.” Accessed November 9, 2023.
                      <a href="#page-https-www-teamlab-art" target="_blank">https://www.teamlab.art/</a>.</span></cite>) and traveling exhibits such as the Van Gogh Experience.
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Van Gogh Exhibition</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Van Gogh Exhibition: The Immersive Experience.” Accessed

                      <a href="#page-https-vangoghexpo-com" target="_blank">https://vangoghexpo.com/</a>.</span></cite>) However, there is a fundamental difference between this and
                  a volumetric hologram. If there are ruins or walls to project
                  onto projection mapping is a perfectly viable interpretive
                  tool, taking what we have historically relegated to the mind’s
                  eye and combining it with analytical archaeology or artistic
                  interpretation for a more complete picture. The light
                  projections utilized have something to bounce off to create an
                  image. But in the absence of such a backdrop, or any backdrop
                  at all, projection mapping falters. Bridging this gap is where
                  volumetric holograms become valuable for large scale
                  interpretation, where the absence of structures impacts the
                  efficacy of the story the museum is trying to relay to
                  visitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is critical however that these volumetric holograms assist
                  in interpretive efforts, not conflict with the existing
                  narrative of a site. The digital models must be as accurate
                  and well researched as any other part of museum
                  interpretation, working in tandem with existing exhibits and
                  tours to supplement the site’s story rather than replace it.
                  Dissonance between the two will only serve to confuse or
                  distract visitors. It is likely that three dimensional models
                  will need to be approached the same way as artistic drawings
                  are now; utilizing a combination of comparable historic sites
                  which are still standing, documentary research, and
                  excavation. In this case, the tools in the artist’s toolbox
                  are the things which change, exchanging pencil and paper for
                  programs like CAD and Blender. The freedom of interpretation
                  and artistic expression do not. From there, integrating the
                  resulting model is familiar ground for the museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once this initial hurdle is crossed, the next primary concern
                  is spatial accuracy. Any structures, landscape features, or
                  architectural details restored with light should ideally line
                  up with their historic counterparts, or else risk the same
                  dissonance in the understanding of the viewer as with an
                  inaccurate model. Again, however, this is not necessarily new
                  ground. Advancements with Global Positioning Systems (GPS),
                  Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Light Detection and
                  Ranging (LiDAR) have allowed for increasingly precise surveys
                  of features on the ground, which, when combined with
                  traditional research methods like Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps
                  and probate inventories, provide a picture of a historic
                  landscape which was unthinkable only a few decades ago. It is
                  likely that a good volumetric hologram, which is both
                  historically accurate and visually comprehensible, will need
                  to utilize both the broad accuracy measurements these provide
                  with the fine detail work of the dimensional modeling. As
                  such, it should come as a comfort that the technology for
                  these steps is already so well established.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also alluded to but left undiscussed in this research has been
                  the matter of cost. At present, the speculative technologies
                  discussed in this paper are prototypes and proofs of concepts,
                  with no associated costs publicly known. However, it can be
                  expected that whatever initial technology makes it to the
                  consumer market will almost certainly not be cheap. Though, as
                  with all technology, this will decrease with time. While our
                  stated ideal involves a projection easily run by museum staff,
                  outside contractors may be considered on a temporary basis to
                  mitigate the costs of the machine and computer modeling for
                  what is likely to be a trial run of such events.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The proposed benefits to interpretation and the understanding
                  of visitors may well outweigh the costs and challenges
                  volumetric holograms bring with them. Museums are no stranger
                  to these kinds of calculations, and the emergence of a new
                  technology should excite as much interest as it does wariness.
                  These issues are delicate, but not insurmountable, and the
                  resulting creation has the potential to add an unmatched new
                  tool to assist our storytelling.

                <h2>Where we go From Here</h2>
                <p>
                  Technology is never stagnant. People look at what they have
                  and use on a day-to-day basis, and dream of something better.
                  Creative endeavors like <em>Star Wars</em> show us a future
                  which, while fraught with war and struggle, is filled with
                  technology that we can only imagine. And then, we try to make
                  it a reality. We start experimenting, and wondering if we
                  really could have what we saw on the screen: a cell phone, an
                  intelligent robot, or even a hologram. Incremental
                  improvements are made, refined, and released as each moves us
                  one step closer to the machinery we imagine. Volumetric
                  holograms have captured the collective human imagination, and
                  designers, programmers, and artists are racing to catch up.
                  Their utilization in the museum, at least in their ideal form,
                  poses many potential benefits. This is especially true in
                  large scale landscape interpretation which at present is so
                  limited by the risks and costs associated with reconstruction,
                  but is so critical for the interpretation of context of a now
                  ruined structure or estate. Despite their likely costs, the
                  elimination of reliance on the imagination of a visitor may
                  allow for more accurate interpretation and information to be
                  imparted by the museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  No interpretation method can be completely perfect, but the
                  possibilities which volumetric holograms provide may allow for
                  a new horizon for museums to utilize. In the next few decades,
                  we could see slave quarters projected atop their foundations
                  showing the spread of an estate far past the main house. We
                  could see the engineering feats of indigenous groups like the
                  Hopewell recreated to tower over us. We may see Roman ruins
                  and temples, once lost to the impacts of time, restored to
                  completeness, if only for a moment. Maybe, in the corner,
                  we’ll add a small Carrie Fisher, pleading for the fate of the
                  galaxy, just to remind us how far we’ve come.

                  Thanks to new technology and post-pandemic culture shifts in
                  the way we engage with spaces in person and online, the demand
                  for recreation of physical spaces on digital platforms for
                  education and recreation has never been higher. Advances in
                  <a href="#page-https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-photogrammetry" target="_blank">photogrammetry</a>
                  technology and VR integration have created new possibilities
                  for taking real objects and environments and recreating them
                  in explorable digital spaces. Potentially a result of the
                  COVID-19 pandemic, there is a strong desire for people to
                  experience meaningful places, which is evident in the travel
                  industry’s rebound as pandemic regulations lessened. People
                  desire to return to spaces that bring comfort and meaning, as
                  well as to experience things they could not during periods of
                  closure. Those who can’t travel find other ways to engage with
                  places they are nostalgic for, including through online
                  communities or through materials produced by museums and
                  historic sites. Audiences look for interesting ways to
                  experience meaningfully designed spaces as they remember them
                  through online formats, including through increasingly popular
                  theme park attraction ride-through videos,

                  An exploration of nostalgia and how it pertains to preserving
                  designed space inspired the following look at museums and
                  virtual reality. While considering the benefits of digitizing
                  existing exhibits for VR, I looked at the very active online
                  fan communities that exist around theme parks. Despite their
                  dedication being focused on for-profit parks and resorts,
                  theme park fans go to great lengths to record, document, and
                  digitize the histories of theme parks and attractions that
                  currently stand or that have long since been demolished or
                  modified. Rich, crowdsourced histories exist of Walt Disney
                  World rides from development to demolition. Extensive,
                  multi-POV ride through videos exist of attractions at parks
                  all around the world for those who may not have the chance to
                  visit them. Ambitious fans, such as those behind the
                  <a href="#page-https-www-polygon-com-2021-1-8-22219427-disney-ride-20000-leagues-under-the-sea-watch-vr-defunctland" target="_blank">Defunctland VR Project</a>, have gone so far as to recreate entire ride experiences in
                  VR so that fans can experience lost attractions in full detail
                  once again. These projects are generated by themed
                  entertainment audience members who long to capture the work
                  that went into creating designed space and what it was like to
                  experience said attraction firsthand. These audiences aren’t
                  just a niche either—the
                  <a href="#page-https-www-youtube-com-channel-ucvo63lbkhjc04kqyhwsz-pg" target="_blank">Defunctland YouTube channel</a>
                  regularly nets millions of views on their extensively
                  researched theme park history videos. Visitors feel a strong
                  sense of attachment to themed entertainment settings, often
                  strengthened by nostalgia for travel and for time spent with
                  family. I often see discussions online from fan communities
                  about theme parks, but rarely to the same degree about
                  museums.

                  While theme parks and museums might not immediately seem tied
                  closely together, they are both tourism destinations that are
                  designed to intentionally immerse visitors in an environment
                  where they are most receptive to the products or information
                  shared within them. The
                  <a href="#page-https-www-teaconnect-org" target="_blank">Themed Entertainment Association</a>
                  recognizes the close interconnectivity and shared audiences of
                  museums and theme parks for the tourism industry in the
                  experience economy. In both worlds, visitors’ complete
                  experiences are curated from entrance to exit to provide the
                  best possible visit. Both sectors strive to make the
                  experience of visiting memorable, unique, and distinct from
                  other places to foster a relationship with the guest. Exhibits
                  are designed to provide an environment that is complimentary
                  to the content—whether that is through immersive exhibits in
                  science museums or carefully curated spaces of reflection in
                  art museums. Museum objects do not exist out of place, the
                  space and presentation of how they are perceived are integral
                  to the creation of memory and the overall experience of the
                  visitor. Visitors will remember what’s meaningful because of
                  the wholistic experience, not just the objects themselves.

                  Theme park enthusiasts work hard to document park experiences
                  by sharing them while they are operational online for others
                  to see, or by painstakingly recreating demolished attractions
                  through photographs, video, and VR—largely because they know
                  the park ownership will not. Rebecca Williams’ work on fandom
                  culture around theme parks discusses that fan memorialization
                  of theme park attractions may help provide a method of
                  reassuring “ontological security” by allowing fans to
                  re-articulate and re-explore their attachments to rides and
                  exhibits and the associated memories tied to them. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Williams 2020, 213</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Williams, Rebecca.

                        participatory cultures</em>. Amsterdam University Press, 2020.</span></cite>) I believe that museum audiences are more like these theme
                  park enthusiasts than we typically discuss, but have a
                  different relationship of attachment to museums as sites to
                  preserve—the obligation to preserve museum spaces and their
                  history is not in the hands of fan-historians working against
                  corporate ownership but instead is a role for museums
                  themselves. Museums have a reputation of record keeping and
                  preservation, and there is an expectation of diligence in
                  documentation. When given ways to engage with museum exhibits
                  past and present online, I believe museum audiences similarly
                  re-explore their attachments in a way that fosters their
                  positive relationship with institutions. Virtual reality,
                  while primarily used for tours and outreach online for current
                  exhibits, allows museums to create records of their exhibits
                  that allow audiences to connect to their collections remotely
                  or after exhibits close. Maintaining the emotional connection
                  between visitors and exhibit spaces allows guests to explore
                  feelings of nostalgia and wonder linked to spatial memory,
                  helping encourage repeat visitorship, foster donor
                  relationships, and maintain positive feelings about the
                  institution.

                  Resources for creating Virtual Reality tours have become more
                  accessible, creating new possibilities for how exhibits are
                  documented and displayed online. Some museums, such as the
                  National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) are ahead of the
                  crowd with
                  <a href="#page-https-naturalhistory-si-edu-visit-virtual-tour" target="_blank">many virtual tours of exhibits past and present</a>
                  available on their website. Others have gone further and
                  created exhibit experiences in third party game software.
                  Still many other institutions have never considered creating
                  VR versions of their exhibits and would not know where to
                  begin. With the increasing pressure on museums to provide
                  online resources, I believe that utilizing VR to document
                  exhibits serves an important twofold function—it creates a
                  means by which audiences can engage with the museum from home
                  and it creates a record of the holistic experience of
                  exhibitions that can be used by museum fans and museum
                  academics when we discuss exhibit design.

                <h3>Virtual Reality and Preserved Museum Spaces</h3>
                <p>
                  The most widely used method of documenting real space in full
                  is using 360° cameras. Utilized in industries such as house
                  tours for real estate, mapping software, and in museums, 360°
                  cameras capture the panoramic details of a location through
                  photography. Typically done with omnidirectional cameras which
                  capture a picture in every direction at the same time,
                  panoramic images of spherical videos create a 3D effect
                  without being 3D. These pictures can be shared as 2D images
                  which can be navigated by scrolling or by following paths of
                  associated images that have been connected. Commonly used
                  services such as Google Photos and Facebook both have
                  integration for sharing these types of panoramic images. They
                  may also be captured for conversion for use in VR, which can
                  provide a more organic way for viewers to explore the space.

                  exhibits, although more expensive and therefore less often

                  The 2020 global pandemic acted as a catalyst for museums to
                  evaluate their digital footprint as the world adapted to
                  engaging with learning and culture through digital formats
                  during lock down and subsequent periods of high-risk
                  transmission. Museums who could not serve the public on-site
                  needed to find ways to engage their audiences through other
                  means, and more and more institutions took their first leap
                  into utilizing technology to provide some kind of supplemental
                  experience. While many museums opted to provide tours or
                  programs facilitated through video format over zoom or through
                  prerecorded tours, other museums with resources to do so chose
                  to innovate using XR technology (a catchall term for Virtual
                  Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality experiences).
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Gerencer 2021</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Gerencer, Tom. “What Is Extended Reality (XR) and How Is

                  provide additional interpretation to exhibits, sometimes
                  in-lieu of contact with educators. Other museums found ways to
                  present their collections of objects online, often in
                  blank-walled digital galleries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These digital galleries, albeit useful for the museum to share
                  their objects, may not integrate the thoughtful design of the
                  exhibitions that objects are presented within. While this may
                  work for certain types of collections such as art museums, it
                  fails to provide the immersion of experiencing an exhibit
                  in-context and does not create the nostalgic triggers
                  associated with seeing a work of art or exhibit in the context
                  of the museum space itself. This may lead to less association
                  between the viewer and the museum, as opposed to just the
                  object being presented. However, the blank-walled VR rooms
                  provide a fast way for museums to present art in explorable
                  space next to other associated works, likely saves work hours
                  and design costs to create, and do not require museums to
                  purchase cameras needed for fuller capture of the exhibit
                  environment.

                  Diseño in Costa Rica, the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit,
                  and the Wallace Collection in the United Kingdom. These VR
                  experiences allow museums to provide online experiences for
                  actively running exhibits, as well as preserve an online
                  archive of past exhibits. The digitization of the exhibit in
                  full context helps maintain the museum’s ownership of the
                  space and content in our associated memory. Vortic’s platform
                  also provides institutions the ability to host meetings,
                  tours, and events in their VR spaces, which helps transform
                  their VR exhibit environments from stagnant recreations of a
                  floor plan to settings that can be alive, discussed, and
                  experienced. Despite the convenience of Vortic’s services, the
                  potentially expensive per-month hosting and usage costs may
                  prevent smaller institutions from utilizing the platform for
                  their exhibits.

                  The VR format allows museums to preserve more than just the
                  spatial details of exhibits. As demonstrated thorough the Los
                  Angeles Museum of Art’s <em>Substrata</em>
                  <a href="#page-https-epoch-gallery-substrata" target="_blank">virtual exhibit hosted on the digital exhibition platform
                    EPOCH</a>, exhibits can integrate audio and ambiance into the
                  experience of viewing. Just as museums are not spaces void of
                  noise, music, and designed sound in person, digital exhibits
                  can also integrate audio into the experience. Not only does
                  this more closely mimic the experience a visitor might have
                  while viewing an exhibit and therefore more likely trigger
                  associated feelings of nostalgia, but it also offers a place
                  for the soundtracks designed for museum settings to continue
                  to live on past the exhibit’s in-person lifespan.
                  <em>Unsettled</em>, an exhibition created by the Australian
                  Museum, integrates audio that is key to the visitor experience
                  in-person into their
                  <a href="#page-https-australian-museum-learn-first-nations-unsettled" target="_blank">virtual tour</a>. In doing this, the virtual experience becomes closer to the
                  in-person experience and creates a space where the
                  compositions made for the exhibit continue to serve their
                  purpose.

                <h3>VR Museums in Game Spaces</h3>
                <p>
                  Recently, museums have begun to recognize the value of
                  partnering with video game companies to reach broader
                  audiences. Platforms such as Roblox, VR Chat, Second Life, and
                  Sansar provide existent platforms to host exhibits and
                  collaboration events within. This has certain benefits—these
                  platforms already have existing audiences that the museum can
                  draw from to expand viewership. They may already have
                  integrated creator tools and assets that make the process of
                  setting up the exhibit faster or more streamlined.
                  Partnerships with platforms benefit both parties and may help
                  cut costs of development or provide free advertising for the
                  partnering museum. However, it also has downsides. Although
                  true of most software that is not developed in-house, there is
                  no guarantee of the lifespan of the platform hosting the
                  virtual exhibit. Ownership of companies, hosting costs, and
                  collaborator interests all mean that there is no guarantee
                  that a digital exhibit created in these spaces will have
                  longevity. While innovative, game platforms can be a risky
                  place for museums to invest all their VR resources.

                  audience pool than if hosted on the SAAM site.

                    Second Life</a>. Over the pandemic, the Peale collaborated with Linden Labs,
                  the company behind both Second Life and Sansar, to recreate
                  the Peale and its exhibits on the platform. This undertaking
                  had twofold purposes—to allow visitors to continue to access
                  the Peale and its collections from home, as well as to allow
                  the staff and museum collaborators to meet in a setting that
                  allowed them to better activate their connection to the museum
                  while working remotely. This connectivity to the museum site
                  helped keep staff enthusiastic and connected to the collection
                  and helped them better understand their space so they could
                  develop projects even while away. The virtual Peale became
                  both a meeting space and an extension of Peale’s mission.

                  Hosting exhibits in game platforms allows virtual visitors
                  more expression, more movement, and often more detail.
                  However, the game element can also be a hindrance to the goal
                  of the content. Because it is hosted in Second Life, which
                  offers robust player avatar customization, the virtual Peale
                  is no stranger to player avatar attire not suitable for a
                  museum setting and had to create a dress code for the online
                  space. Similarly, player behavior can be unpredictable in any
                  type of game. Fortnite’s
                  <a href="#page-https-theconversation-com-fortnites-new-in-game-holocaust-museum-shows-us-a-virtual-future-for-education-215500" target="_blank">virtual Holocaust Museum</a>
                  specifically has paired down game-play features and disabled
                  emotes to preserve the respectful tone of the exhibit
                  experience—a lesson that was learned from rowdy player
                  behavior at the virtual Martin Luther King experience hosted
                  before. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Gilliam 2021</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Gilliam, Ryan. “Fortnite’s MLK Event Is a Weird Way to

                  interacts with VR exhibits and how, and museums should

                <h3>Archiving Designed Space For Museum Scholars</h3>
                <p>
                  I believe there is value in documenting exhibit design for
                  educational and evaluative purposes for the museum field.
                  Operating with limited budgets, it’s understanding that
                  museums taking the effort to digitize exhibits for the sake of
                  the museum field can be seen as self-serving. But as a
                  graduate student, I have had many moments during research
                  where I desperately wished I could see exhibits that are no
                  longer standing to answer questions about how artifacts or
                  theming were presented in-context, how guests navigated spaces
                  and if they were accessible, or simply about how an exhibit on
                  a topic was handled by a museum. For academics who want to
                  innovate in the museum field, it feels remiss the
                  documentation of exhibits in-full is something that’s not more
                  widely done. Museum’s self-presented exhibit archives online
                  are often simple splash pages about what existed before--
                  occasionally, the more detailed include installation photos or
                  collection details. I am always thankful when a virtual tour
                  is available when researching museums, allowing me to compare
                  content even when I don’t have the privilege to see a site in
                  person.
                </p>

                  A resource that made me consider the value documentation of
                  past exhibits is Zoolex. Created by the Zoo Design
                  Association,
                  <a href="#page-https-zoolex-org" target="_blank">Zoolex</a>
                  collects museum-submitted profiles about zoo and aquarium
                  habitats around the world. The database provides information
                  about zoo design, displays innovations in exhibit design
                  through photograph documentation and exhibit layout drawings,
                  and even provides climate data about the environmental
                  conditions of the habitat. Created as the result of Monika
                  Ebenhöh’s thesis “Improvements in Zoo Design by Internet-Based
                  Exchange of Expertise”, Zoolex acts as a resource for zoo
                  designers and caretakers. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ebenhöh 1992</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ebenhöh, Monika. “Improvements in Zoo Design by

                      University of Georgia, 1992.</span></cite>) I yearn for a similar multi-institutional database for
                  exhibit designers in the broader field. While Zoolex does not
                  provide fully digitized exhibit layouts, the photo
                  documentation alongside design information is an excellent for
                  visualizing space for those researching their exhibits. What
                  would a multi-institutional database for past exhibits look
                  like and could it be viable? That’s hard to say—the audience
                  could be niche, and like Zoolex, museums would need to opt
                  into summitting their own gallery tours or images. However, it
                  would be an amazing resource to have the ability to search
                  exhibitions up by topic to compare how they were handled at
                  institutions around the world and across time, allowing
                  designers to be inspired by what has come before, double check
                  their own work for accidental plagiarism from exhibits they
                  saw before but may have forgotten, and to compare how the same
                  topic might be exhibited to different audiences globally.

                  Some institutions like the National Museum of Natural History
                  have established digitization resources, such as the team they
                  dub the “Laser Cowboys”. The Laser Cowboys of the Smithsonian
                  Digitization Program Office’s 3D lab use laser scanners to
                  document exhibitions, such as the massive Fossil Hall before
                  it’s renovation in 2014. During that project, “cowboy” Adam
                  Metallo said: “The main purpose of 3D scanning an exhibit like
                  this is to have an archive of what an exhibit of this era
                  might have looked. This is a documentation for folks in the
                  future to know what a museum experience here was like.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Smithsonian Magazine 2013</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Smithsonian Magazine. “A Night at the Museum with the

                  objects for public access, but for documenting how the
                  exhibit’s design and context might be useful for designers and
                  academics in the future. While it can sometimes be hard to
                  justify the time and cost of digitization, the archival value
                  to the museum field is immense. It is my hope other museums
                  who have the resources to will also choose to document their
                  exhibits for this reason, especially ones that have such high
                  visitation or cultural impact such as NMNH.

                <h3>Barriers to Creating VR Exhibits</h3>
                <p>
                  While it would be amazing if every museum could digitize their
                  exhibits, the reality as discussed is that there are many
                  barriers to undertaking VR projects. While not every 3D
                  digitization project requires thousands of man-hours of work
                  to complete, they do all require some level of flexibility by
                  staff to take time, usually before or after operational hours,
                  to do the manual work of photographing or laser-scanning the
                  space. Most institutions do not have a team already trained in
                  photogrammetry technology, let alone in creating digital
                  programming, so time and financial resources are required to
                  train staff and purchase equipment or to hire external
                  contractors to complete the project. Even after the work of
                  scanning is completed, the institution then needs to host,
                  publish, or save the files for present or future use, which
                  requires the digital resources to do so. For institutions who
                  choose to partner with platforms like VR Chat or Second Life,
                  there must be staff available to manage the relationship with
                  the software and who can integrate the exhibit materials onto
                  the platform. These skills don’t come overnight, especially
                  for museums who have yet to adopt newer technologies. The
                  output of a virtual tour may require an entirely new staff
                  role (or more) just to get off the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Outside of just the startup costs involved in taking on VR
                  projects, the longevity of VR exhibits once published is also
                  uncertain. Unless a museum has a robust team dedicated to
                  digital projects already, they are likely relying on outside
                  parties when hosting and creating their VR exhibits. Whether
                  this is through services such as Google, Second Life, or
                  Matterport, there needs to be somewhere to put the digitized
                  exhibit so that visitors can interface with it. While
                  companies expect their continued lifespans, the retirement of
                  the widely used Adobe Flash highlights that something that is
                  expected to be lasting and easy to integrate onto a web
                  platform isn’t necessarily going to stick around. Virtual
                  exhibits created on third-party platforms have an uncertain
                  fate if companies like Matterport or Vortic close. Could the
                  museum reuse the scans on another platform, especially if they
                  used proprietary scanning techniques during the image
                  collection process? Are there ways for the museum to keep
                  versions of the tours that don’t require any specific
                  software? These are questions to consider when we think about
                  the fate of digital exhibits that exist now. The National
                  Museum of Natural History supports the future of their digital
                  exhibit tours by working with virtual reality artist Loren
                  Ybarrondo, who coded their virtual tours in HTML5 and
                  JavaScript for specific use by the institution, meaning no
                  additional software is required to host. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ybarrondo 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ybarrondo, Loren. “Loren Ybarrondo: Create Immersive

                  their VR projects, their budget allows for commissioned
                  coding. But other institutions may not have the same ownership
                  of their work and could grapple with hosting issues in the
                  future.

                  For smaller museums just trying to get a VR project off the
                  ground, uncertain hosting futures and usage rights can make
                  planning difficult. To help alleviate some of the resource
                  strain on museums starting up VR projects,
                  <a href="#page-https-artsandculture-google-com-story-egwrnanxklb0zg" target="_blank">Google Arts &amp; Culture</a>
                  has initiatives and funding to provide different kinds of 3D
                  digitization services for free, and host VR tours of museums
                  and cultural sites on their platform. Partnering with Google
                  reduces the work on the museum teams themselves, but comes
                  with the complications of partnering with a massive company
                  that comes with its own corporate complications about access,
                  usage rights, user data, and funding that not every
                  institution is willing to sacrifice on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not every museum is likely to be sold on the pitch of 3D
                  digitization of exhibits. Some might value the temporal nature
                  of exhibitions and prefer to let them exist and then pass as
                  part of their process. Other museums may be protective of
                  their materials such as architectural details, lighting
                  design, or the artworks shown inside an exhibit. Some museums
                  may fear that a digital version of an exhibit will dissuade
                  in-person visitation. Artist’s usage rights might control the
                  digital use of their works, which may prevent inclusion in VR
                  exhibits. Anything from the unwillingness to use budget
                  resources to a distrust of digital platforms could act as a
                  barrier. For those who have already undertaken VR exhibit
                  efforts, there is also the possibility of discouragement – a
                  first VR exhibit experience might have been costly and time
                  consuming while learning the ropes, which may put teams off
                  from continuing to digitize more. Teams must grapple with
                  where to invest resources if VR exhibits aren’t getting the
                  outreach draw that were expected, even if the end product is
                  impressive and archivally useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The pitch to executives and donors to invest resources in
                  digitization can be difficult. Even the purest academic value
                  of preservation of exhibits for the museum field is unlikely
                  to be enough to sell VR exhibits to those who don’t see the
                  immediate value. But as discussed when considering audience
                  nostalgia of exhibits and attractions, there are ways to
                  articulate the value of digitized spaces that serve many
                  museum’s goals of legacy, audience retention, and outreach.
                  Pushing past the novelty of the medium can be difficult, but a
                  thoughtful argument can express how preserving exhibit spaces
                  benefit museum audiences past, present, and future. Museums
                  audiences are fan-bases, and just like nostalgic theme park
                  fans, they want to feel connected with places they associate
                  with recreation, learning, and family. Museums can take
                  ownership of their body of exhibition work and their own
                  nostalgic legacy by creating VR exhibits for their audiences
                  that help them remember, connect, and continue to learn even
                  long after an exhibit has been taken down. By doing so, they
                  can control their relationship to their audiences now, and to
                  audiences in the future looking back at what once was.

                  Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere. With the
                  creation of <em>Siri</em>, <em>Alexa</em>, and other virtual
                  command search engines, we can engage with information in a
                  more interactive and interpersonal way. An extension of this
                  development is generative artificial intelligence, or
                  generative AI, which the World Economic Forum defines as
                  “artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning
                  algorithms to create new content in the form of images, text,
                  audio, and more” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Routley 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Routley, Nick. “What is Generative AI? An AI explains.”

                  In another session, I asked ChatGPT to craft a poem in the

                  historical allusions to the late president, including his

                  it also wrote rhyming structures and an original title.

                  Whether with humorous user intention or not, generative AI has
                  the potential to change how online users engage with people,
                  learn new trends, and transform how we think about our
                  routines and the world around us. Specifically, ChatGPT is
                  beginning to transform the education sector, as teachers and
                  professors are working to adapt to using (or prohibiting the
                  use of) ChatGPT in their classrooms. As ChatGPT and other
                  forms of generative AI become popular discussion topics within
                  the legal and educational sectors, it has also become
                  increasingly provocative within the museum sector. With these
                  technological developments, a new question for studying and
                  interpreting history is apparent: What if we used generative
                  AI to transport us into the past? Within this think piece, I
                  will explore the agency of historical figures in current
                  museum exhibitions and inquire how museums take precautions
                  with using AI.

                  The question of authenticity and technology collaborating
                  within a museum space predates the invention of generative AI.
                  Specifically, conversations around “deep fakes” in museums
                  have been around since at least the mid-2010s. For instance,
                  scholars Jenny Kidd and Arran J. Rees write about AI within
                  the greater humanities field, ranging from 3D prints of
                  Rembrandt artworks to the generative artwork Portrait of
                  Edmond Belamy selling for $432,500 in 2018 (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Kidd 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Kidd, Jenny, and Arran J.

                  a negative connotation. Some journalists have argued that AI
                  perpetuates “fake news” and misinformation, especially when
                  addressing AI-generated videos of using someone’s likeness to

                  Generative AI has a controversial use case in nearly every
                  industry, including the museum sector. While there has been
                  discourse around chatbots in museums within the past decade,
                  AI platforms like ChatGPT are a novelty in the museum sector,
                  leaving much to be discovered. In some areas, ChatGPT excels,

                  accurately cite sources and its inability to perform simple
                  mathematical problems (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Merritt 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Merritt, Elizabeth. “Chatting About Museums with

                  generating text, many workers in writing-based careers are
                  worried that the AI platform will replace them. Moreover,
                  ChatGPT and other AI platforms have a track record of
                  perpetuating racism and bias. In 2018, several users of

                  I asked AI Anne Frank four questions. Each response I received
                  was very academic and reflective in tone. For instance, when I
                  asked AI Anne about her legacy, she responded the following
                  about her famed diary: “Though initially written as a personal
                  outlet during our period of hiding, it has become a symbol of
                  resilience and hope in the face of adversity.”

                  I then asked former Soviet ruler Vladimir Lenin the same
                  question: “What is your legacy?” In his response, he stated
                  that his legacy “lies in the revolutionary zeal with which I
                  dedicated myself to advancing the cause of the proletariat.”
                  When I asked about his views on the demise of the Russian
                  Royal Romanov family, AI Lenin responded with the following:
                  “[I]t remains a matter of debate as to what extent I

                  Using AI platforms can provide a growth opportunity for
                  museums, whether it be generating ideas for how to organize an
                  exhibition or aiding in digital preservation. However, it is
                  important to note that this product is only valuable when a
                  human uses it. As Merritt poses the question of whether or not
                  museum staff should use ChatGPT as a writing and research
                  tool, she also asserts that human staff would need to be
                  present to do fact-checking and assess the platform’s
                  language. This shows that an AI platform cannot completely
                  replace a human being’s work. Major institutions
                  <a href="#page-https-datascience-si-edu-ai-values-statement" target="_blank">like the Smithsonian</a>
                  have incorporated values statements regarding their use of AI.
                  While the Smithsonian embraces using AI tools to aid in the
                  digitization and discoverability of historic materials and
                  source communities online, the institution asserts it will
                  only use technologies that respect its public and represent
                  the values of its institution (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">AI Values Statement 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“AI Values Statement.” AI Values Statement | Smithsonian

                </h2>
                <p>
                  What are some ways that museums can use AI to represent
                  history in their exhibitions? A possible answer can be
                  provided in the tailored use of generative AI in the Salvador
                  Dalí Museum and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
                  (USHMM). In 2019, for instance, the Salvador Dalí Museum
                  utilized DALL-E, “sibling” software to ChatGPT, to splice
                  photos, videos, and recordings of Dalí’s mannerisms and vocal
                  patterns to create a realistic likeness of the late surrealist
                  painter (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Dalí Museum 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Salvador Dalí Museum. “Dalí Lives (via Artificial

                  projection of Dalí would create another avenue for visitors to
                  explore Dalí’s creative mind and inspiration for his
                  celebrated artworks. At the end of the exhibit, the
                  AI-generated Dalí asks his visitors if they would like to take
                  a picture with him, and he takes a selfie using a smartphone
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Dalí Museum 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Salvador Dalí Museum. “Dalí Lives (via Artificial

                  smartphone was in his lifetime–let alone know how to take a
                  selfie with one–as he passed away in the late 1980s.
                  Therefore, is it wrong for the museum to share this minute
                  inaccuracy about Dalí’s life? What other ramifications can
                  historical AI figures bring?

                  Regarding the Dalí Museum, I was drawn to Hank Hine’s
                  (Executive Director) emphasis on using AI Salvador Dalí to add
                  another layer of empathy to the exhibit (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Dalí Museum 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Salvador Dalí Museum. “Dalí Lives (via Artificial

                  the exhibit of his famous works, I can see how visitors would
                  have a more nuanced understanding of Dalí’s creative vision.
                  The desire for empathic reasoning and a dedicated mission to
                  crafting accurate portrayals of a historical figure’s identity
                  is commendable and should be the expectation within a museum
                  setting. It is evident to me that the Dalí Museum has curated
                  a version of Salvador Dalí that honors his artistic views and
                  offers insightful commentary on his artwork.

Through this initiative, visitors can ask and actively
                  converse with survivors about their lives before, during, and
                  after the Holocaust. The answers are pre-recorded from living
                  survivors, and docents are around to help visitors craft their
                  questions. While this initiative brings an interpersonal layer
                  to the exhibit, it also raises questions about the spectator
                  being the main focus rather than the survivor’s experience.

                  However, as Stephen Smith (Executive Director of the USC Shoah

                  museum staff and third-party partners. Museums also have a
                  plethora of resources–from digital catalogs to informational
                  videos–which fosters a dynamic learning environment. As the
                  Smithsonian’s AI Values Statement shares, it is imperative
                  that the museum documents how its AI content is produced and
                  for what purpose it serves (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">AI Values Statement 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“AI Values Statement.” AI Values Statement | Smithsonian

                  how the bias aids the museum in its programming. Some central
                  messages from the AI Values Statement are the need for
                  continuous supervision of AI tools and clear distinction of
                  when AI is used, for what reason, and where exactly it draws
                  its data from (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">AI Values Statement 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“AI Values Statement.” AI Values Statement | Smithsonian

                  drew input from all corners of the Internet, including
                  divisive, discriminatory, and flamingly incorrect information,
                  with very little sign of oversight from the app’s AI team. As
                  Chadda previously shared, his product would be more successful
                  if it had better training. Therefore, museums should follow
                  the AI Values Statement in continuing to review the
                  information they are inputting in their AI-generated
                  initiatives and the legality of its use.

                <p>
                  Generative AI is a new phenomenon in the legal field,
                  especially concerning copyright law. Copyright law states that
                  someone can be the sole owner of their work for the time of
                  their lifetime plus 70 years after their death (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Frank 2015</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Frank, Will. “IP-rimer: A Basic Explanation of

In a museum setting, could family or descendants have
                  copyright over their ancestor’s image? According to the
                  National Library of Medicine, only if the ancestor (especially
                  if they were famous in their lifetime) has a current
                  foundation and license to use their likeness (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">National Library of Medicine 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">National Library of Medicine. “Copyright: Patron Guide to

                  Additionally, intellectual property claims–or, claims that
                  focus on the legal protection of one’s ideas and creative
                  work–can be poorly received in some cases. For example, if
                  someone uses intellectual property law to censor someone’s
                  criticisms of their work, then the courts will often rule
                  against the plaintiff, or person who started the legal case
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Frank 2015</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Frank, Will. “IP-rimer: A Basic Explanation of

With this legal observation, could some courts dismiss
                  copyright claims to the portrayal of AI historical figures in
                  museum exhibitions?

                <p>
                  According to a <em>Reuters</em> report in August 2023,
                  AI-generated art cannot be copyrighted, since it was not
                  directly made by a human artist (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Brittain 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Brittain, Blake. “AI-generated art cannot receive

With this knowledge in mind, would copyright laws impede a
                  museum’s ability to use AI projections in future exhibitions?
                  The United States Congress is assessing various arguments for
                  and against the use of AI across the country (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Zirpoli 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Zirpoli, Christopher T. “Generative Artificial

                  necessary to file for a copyright claim. Without human beings
                  to advocate for themselves, it appears that AI can be used to
                  reconfigure a historical person’s likeness.

                <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
                <p>
                  AI is not going anywhere. It is not only beginning to hold
                  influence in museums but the greater workforce and our legal
                  landscape. Earlier this month in November of 2023, the
                  SAG-AFTRA Union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and
                  Television Producers (AMPTP) reached an agreement that studios
                  must compensate and receive consent from the actor to allow
                  generative AI to replicate their likeness (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Klar 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Klar, Rebecca. “SAG-AFTRA releases agreement, details AI
                      protections.” <em>The Hill</em>. November 13, 2023.

This case will likely help reinforce the precedent that
                  consent is needed to generate AI based on a living person;
                  however, the legality of using an AI replica of a deceased
                  person is not always quite as clear.

                  AI is being explored as a tool for crafting an engaging
                  visitor experience. However, there are ethical considerations
                  that should be made when experimenting with AI. As code and
                  algorithms are made by humans, they come with complexities
                  that require human literacy and understanding. Technology can
                  surprise machines and humans alike. As stated by museum
                  experts Ariana French and Elena Villaespesa, the sector should
                  establish clear expectations for how AI should be used in
                  their museums and allocate their resources accordingly (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">French and Villaespesa 2019</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">French, Ariana, and Elena Villaespesa. “AI, Visitor

                <p>
                  As the USHMM and the Dalí Museum illustrate, museums can use
                  AI effectively if they can strategically tailor their
                  programming to a specific language that holds the integrity of
                  the history they are representing. In utilizing a cautious
                  approach and scheduling frequent training sessions by staff
                  and third-party vendors, AI can be used as a useful
                  educational tool within the museum sector. However, with any
                  new invention, it is essential the museum uses it often and
                  with great review. When used with ethical consideration, AI
                  can be a promising feature for new exhibitions. Museums should
                  continue to use generative AI with great caution.

                  The use of barcodes to catalog and inventory collections is a
                  well-established practice in the museum field. The use of QR
                  codes in exhibits to deliver content is likewise a
                  well-established museum practice. The COVID-19 pandemic
                  allowed the numerous uses and capabilities of QR codes to
                  become fully and broadly realized. This research will examine
                  different type of barcodes, the use of QR codes in museum
                  exhibits, and the use of both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional
                  barcodes in museum collections. Additionally, this research
                  seeks to examine how a shift in museum collections from
                  1-dimensional barcodes to 2-dimensional barcodes could further
                  promote accessibility and efficiency of collections
                  management.

                  Before getting into the use of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional
                  barcodes in both museum exhibitions and collections, we first
                  must define these terms. A barcode is a one-dimensional
                  machine-readable representation of data that encodes
                  information into bars and alphanumeric characters.

                  spacings, and size. This numeric digit code can be scanned
                  with a coherent laser beam, and the reflected light is decoded
                  by the scanner. The deciphered code is then input into a
                  system and calls up information about the object to which the
                  barcode is attached. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Manning 1999</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Manning, William Albert. “Automated Systems in Museums:

                  numeric digit code, inputs the UPC (Universal Product Code)
                  number into the register, and charges you the appropriate

                  A QR code (Quick Response code) is a two-dimensional
                  machine-readable barcode. A QR code is composed of a series of
                  black and white modules, which represent a bit of embedded
                  data, that run both horizontally and vertically (two
                  dimensional) (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Scandit 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Types of Barcodes: Choosing the Right Barcode.” Scandit,

These bits of embedded data can be decoded with a scanner,
                  including most smartphones. QR codes have seen major growth
                  over the past 3 years, especially as a result of the COVID-19
                  pandemic. Museums and other sectors saw a need to minimize
                  high-touch areas, such as restaurant menus and museum signage,
                  to mitigate the further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The
                  capability of QR codes to connect offline media with online
                  content was an appealing solution to this problem emerging
                  worldwide.

                  Even as we shift into a “post-pandemic world”, many businesses
                  and institutions still prefer the QR systems implemented
                  during the pandemic. In 2022, it is estimated that 83.4
                  million smartphone users in the United States scanned a QR
                  code, compared to the estimated 65.7 million in 2020.

                  this research are numeric and alphanumeric data. A key
                  advantage of 2-dimensional barcodes is error-protection
                  formulas, which keeps the data intact and the barcodes
                  scannable even after being damaged.

                <h2>QR codes in exhibits</h2>
                <p>
                  QR codes have been used in museum exhibits for years prior to
                  the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first way museum
                  exhibits have used QR codes is to provide additional
                  information about an exhibit and/or artifact. There are many
                  reasons why certain information would be included in a QR code
                  and not on display text. The first reason is simply aesthetic
                  reasons: too much text on a label is distracting and
                  overwhelming. The second reason is because of the nature of
                  some material, whether audio, digital, or another format,
                  which may be more effectively displayed digitally. The Hammer
                  Museum in Los Angeles has implemented additive QR codes in
                  many exhibits, such as the <em>Witch Hunt</em> exhibition, in
                  which QR codes can be scanned for curator commentary videos,
                  and the <em>Made in L.A.</em> exhibit, in which a QR code for
                  “Angel’s Fruits” by Mario Ayala can be scanned and will
                  redirect the user to a YouTube playlist. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Miranda 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Miranda, Carolina A. “The Curse of QR Codes in Museums.”

                <p>
                  Additionally, QR codes can provide a greater understanding of
                  artist intent and creation process through multimedia content
                  from the artist. In the
                  <em>The Land Carries Our Ancestors: Contemporary Art by Native
                    Americans</em>
                  exhibit at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.,
                  sign postings (Figure 1) throughout the exhibit redirect
                  museum patrons to audio tracks in which the artists discuss
                  their work and their personal connection to the land. Use of
                  QR codes in this way can transcend the limitations of
                  traditional wall text and provide visitors with deeper
                  understanding of the objects they are interacting with. Beyond
                  appreciation for the objects and/or artwork itself, QR codes
                  can foster a greater connection and appreciation for the
                  artist, their process, and their community.

                  Another common use for QR codes in museum exhibition is to
                  facilitate self-guided, audio, and multi-lingual tours. This
                  wall text (Figure 2) in the
                  <em>1898: U.S. Imperial Visions and Revisions</em> exhibit at
                  the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery has a QR code which
                  redirects visitors to this site, which offers the exhibit’s
                  section text and wall label text in Filipino, ‘Ōlelo Hawai’i,
                  and CHamoru. Multi-lingual tours encourage guests from around
                  the world to fully engage with the exhibit. Virtual tours can
                  also further accessibility for guests who may be visually
                  impaired, hard of hearing, or neurodivergent.

                  QR codes can also serve as additives to an exhibit through
                  digital assets and collections. Directing patrons to digitized
                  objects allows the experience of getting up close and personal
                  with the object without the conservation and safety concerns.
                  The <em>Galloway Hoard Exhibition</em> was a traveling exhibit
                  of Viking-age objects found in Britain or Ireland. The
                  National Museum of Scotland held this exhibit in the summer of
                  2021 and developed QR codes for the exhibit, which re-directed
                  users to interactive 3D models and photographs of the exhibit
                  objects. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Coulson 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Coulson , Adam. “QR Codes in Museums - Worth the Effort?”

                  the QR codes to determine which digital assets were most
                  popular, and visitor flow through the exhibit. This bird pin
                  was the most scanned 3D object in the exhibit. The Galloway
                  Hoard Exhibition demonstrates how QR codes can foster
                  interdisciplinary collaboration, in this case exhibits and
                  collections, and provide a deeper experience of the
                  institution as a whole to patrons.

                  However, there are some downfalls to QR codes that are out of
                  the museum’s control. Not every patron will scan all the QR
                  codes, some may not scan a single one. Using analytic data,
                  the National Museum of Scotland states that 65k people visited
                  the <em>Galloway Hoard Exhibition</em> and the QR codes were
                  scanned 26k times. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Coulson 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Coulson , Adam. “QR Codes in Museums - Worth the Effort?”

                  This means that anyone with an updated Apple or Android
                  smartphone could scan QR codes without needing to download a
                  separate app, which was required to read QR codes on most
                  smartphones before 2017. However, not everyone who walks
                  through an exhibit will have access to a capable smartphone.
                  This requires museums to carefully consider which information
                  is essential a patron’s experience and understanding of an
                  exhibit. Museums must strive to enrich the experiences of both
                  the QR-scanning patrons and the non-scanning patrons alike.

                  The major pitfall of the use of QR codes in exhibits is
                  complete dependency on them over traditional wall text and
                  object labels. In her article for the Los Angeles Times, “The
                  Curse of QR Codes in Museums,” Carolina Miranda describes the
                  oversaturation of QR codes in some museum exhibits. The author
                  recounts a personal visit to the Los Angeles County Museum of
                  Art’s
                  <em>Mixpantli: Space, Time and the Indigenous Origins of
                    Mexico</em>

                  opening statement and any information about the artist,
                  object, or region had to be accessed via QR code.

                  guests, both disabled and able-bodied, a total dependency on
                  them can also alienate museum guests from connecting with the
                  material and stories being displayed.

                  Through years of implementation across thousands of
                  institutions, the value and shortcomings of QR codes in museum
                  exhibits are becoming fully realized. The important take away
                  is that QR codes can offer exciting opportunities for museum
                  patrons to interact with the exhibits but should not be
                  completely relied on to deliver information. Rather, QR codes
                  should be used in combination with traditional wall text and
                  object labels to foster truer and deeper connections with the
                  objects. The utility of QR codes in exhibits has been
                  demonstrated time and time again, and 2-dimensional barcodes
                  are starting to demonstrate their utility in museum
                  collections as well.

                    “A bar code is part (and not independent) of a larger data

                  Museums across the world have been utilizing barcodes to label
                  and track their collections decades prior to the QR code
                  “boom” of the 2020s. Scanning the barcode will enter the
                  object’s ID number into the Collections Management System
                  (CMS) and pull up the object record. Based on different
                  institution’s documentation procedures, this record may
                  include photos, donor information, accession records, or past
                  condition reports. While they do not replace traditional
                  artifact labeling, barcodes can enhance the speed, accuracy,
                  security, and cost-effectiveness of recording museum objects.
                  Barcodes can be especially useful when conducting an inventory
                  or moving a collection. Barcodes also remove the margin for
                  human error when entering data; it is estimated that the error
                  rate of barcodes is 1 in 36 trillion.

                  require an up-charge. One of the main challenges of

                  the monetary and technology investment required to generate,
                  print, and scan barcodes. The 1-dimensional barcode’s
                  necessary equipment and lack of online capability does not
                  promote growth and access outside of the museum collection.

                  So, why are Collections Managers so attached to traditional
                  barcodes? It is an established system within many
                  institutions, and many may already have the necessary
                  equipment and software. More so, it is a system which has
                  proven its utility. However, 2 dimensional barcodes in museum
                  collections may boast the same advantages as 1-dimensional
                  barcodes with new opportunities, such as connection to online
                  content and greater access without a specialized barcode
                  scanner.

                  For many institutions, QR codes are addressing the
                  shortcomings of 1-dimensional barcodes. While barcodes require
                  software to create, printers, and barcode readers, QR codes
                  can be created very easily and freely online. I created the
                  below QR code (Figure 3) which links to the GWU Museum Studies
                  program webpage for free and in under 60 seconds. Likewise, I
                  used my personal cellphone to scan it. A barcoding project
                  with 2-dimensional barcodes may not require software or
                  scanner, but still requires investment in a barcode label
                  printer.

                  Traditional barcodes can only deliver numeric data, while QR
                  codes can deliver numeric and alphanumeric data. This means QR
                  codes can be used in the same data entry/lookup capacity as
                  1-dimensional barcodes while also being able to link to online
                  resources and multimedia content. Other features that may make
                  QR codes favorable for use in museum collections include high

                  Barcoding the collections reduced the time it took for
                  inventory projects from 2-3 years to 4-6 months. The barcode
                  used in this project was a 2-dimensional barcode, such as a QR
                  code, but utilized only to deliver numeric data. This barcode
                  was affixed to a label, which was tied to the object, along
                  with its unique identifying number and name of object. When
                  scanned, the object’s unique identifying number is entered
                  into the museum’s software “Register,” and pulls up the object
                  record, which includes location, origin, material, and storage
                  condition. This project greatly increased the efficiency,
                  access, and organization of the institution’s collection. The
                  National Museum of Mongolia did not utilize the online
                  capabilities of the 2-dimensional barcodes because of the
                  project scope and resources. This project exemplifies the
                  broad usability of 2-dimensional barcodes, which functioned to
                  deliver numeric data like its 1-dimensional counterparts, but
                  still boasting the advantages of 2-dimensional barcodes, such
                  as high-speed scanning.

                  and on display. The items in storage were attached with a
                  label (Figure 4), which included the object’s barcode, unique
                  identifying number, name, and photo. Instead of using visible
                  barcode labels on the objects on display, a comprehensive

                  created. When scanned, the barcode connects to the object

                  The Museums of History NSW’s barcoding project demonstrates
                  the broad application of QR code technology in collections and
                  across institutions. The world of possibilities for
                  two-dimensional barcodes is fully actualized when used to
                  deliver alphanumeric data and connect to online content. The
                  Museums of History NSW’s comprehensive object list illustrates
                  how 2-dimensional barcodes allow the public to engage with
                  artifacts in a new and deeper way. In a sense, QR code
                  technology can bring the artifacts out of the display cases
                  and storage boxes and into the hands of museum patrons.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  If something’s not broken, why fix it? When you can make it
                  even better than before! Utilizing barcodes to catalog and
                  inventory collections is old news in the museum world.
                  Collections professionals around the world recognize and
                  demonstrate the benefits of barcoding collections, such as
                  reducing human error when entering data and increasing
                  efficiency during inventory projects. As QR codes have
                  populated the exhibit walls of our museums, collections
                  professionals have begun to deliberate if two-dimensional
                  barcodes may be better suited to their institutions and
                  collections management. A shift from 1-dimensional barcodes to
                  2-dimensional barcodes will not increase the efficiency of
                  cataloging or conducting inventory. Rather, it is a more
                  cost-effective option for these projects, eliminating the need
                  for specialized barcode scanners and barcode translators. In
                  many ways, QR codes are metaphorically bringing collections
                  objects out of storage. Shown through the Galloway Hoard
                  Exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland and the
                  barcoding project at The Museums of History NSW’s Vaucluse
                  House, QR code technology is allowing museum guests to engage
                  with collection items in new and exciting ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Integrating QR code technology from museum exhibits into
                  collections will promote greater accessibility of collection
                  items for research and curiosity alike. Implementation of
                  2-dimensional barcodes accessible to the public will further
                  promote transparency and accountability of what museums hold
                  in their collections. Utilizing QR code technology in
                  collections will further foster the relationship between an
                  institution and the public it serves. The efficiency of
                  traditional 1-dimensional barcodes has been demonstrated by
                  numerous institutions. While effectively expediting inventory
                  processes, these barcodes have not done much else outside of
                  collections. Bringing QR codes and other 2-dimensional
                  barcodes into museum collections will likewise expedite
                  catalog and inventory projects, while also allowing the
                  artifacts and stories to reach newer and broader audiences.

                  Imagine you show up to a museum where you are unable to read
                  any of the information, to listen to the docents and guides,
                  or even determine where the bathrooms are located. Maybe it’s
                  a museum in a foreign country. Maybe it’s the museum in your
                  own neighborhood. Either way, that museum is inaccessible to
                  you. Now imagine that in the palm of your hand is a device
                  that can help you read, listen, and find what you are looking
                  for through instant translation of text and speech. While this
                  kind of device is still limited to sci-fi novels and movies,
                  this ability could soon be available to us as machine
                  translation continues to be perfected. As the technology
                  stands now, there are still limitations to what machine
                  translators are able to do, but they can be a helpful tool for
                  museums to use to help expand their community outreach and
                  better serve their multilingual visitors when used in
                  conjunction with human translators.

                  According to US Census Bureau data from 2018-2019, nearly 68
                  million in the United States people speak a language other
                  than English (LOTE) at home. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">US Census 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">U.S. Census Bureau. “Nearly 68 Million People Spoke a

                  growing part of the American population. In some states, 1 in
                  3 people speak a LOTE at home.

                  the opportunity to target these members of their communities.
                  By creating materials in other languages, people may feel more
                  accepted and welcome in a museum. They will also likely be
                  able to learn more about the museum and its collections than
                  if they walked around an exhibit with text in a language they
                  do not speak and be able to ask questions and engage.

                  Many different forms of communication exist within museums
                  that would necessitate translation within a multilingual
                  museum. In her
                  <em>Survey of Translation Practices in Museums,</em> the
                  Manager of Interpretive Media and Resources for the National

                  surveyed museums regularly translated wall text, labels, maps,
                  interpretive brochures, and resources for families.

                  does give some insight to the reasons for early adopters of

                  in 2009 said that the most common reason for multilingual
                  offerings was an institutional mandate to make exhibits and

                <h3>The Limitations of Human Translation</h3>
                <p>
                  Museums often face the challenge of limited resources.
                  Translation services can be prohibitively costly. While the
                  cost can vary, professional translation services for
                  translating the wall text for an exhibit into one other
                  language can cost thousands to tens of thousands of dollars.
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ghazi 2022, 506</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ghazi, Reema. “Translation Practices in Museums: What the

                  including the number of words to be translated, the language
                  that it is being translated to, the content type, turnaround
                  time, and the expertise of the translators.

                      <a href="#page-https-eriksen-com-faqs" target="_blank">https://eriksen.com/faqs/</a>.</span></cite>) Generally, a professional translator costs around $0.10 to
                  $0.30 per word, so a single label with 150 words would cost
                  between $15 and $45. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Bagińska 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Justyna Bagińska, “How Much Does It Cost to Hire a

                  Beyond the price of the translation itself, there are other
                  costs associated with translated text. Languages take up
                  different amounts of space on a wall or page even when they
                  are direct translations. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ghazi 2022, 506</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ghazi, Reema. “Translation Practices in Museums: What the

                  fonts to create all of the characters in that language.

                  In order to cut down on the cost of translation, museums may
                  apply for grants or raise money, but often they rely heavily
                  on bilingual staff to perform translation services. Ghazi’s
                  survey determined that about 75% of museums handled their
                  translation internally by staff, volunteers, or board members.

                  job descriptions though, so employees are being asked to use
                  their language skills beyond what is expected of the position
                  and what may be beyond their actual language skills.

                  huge part of converting text between two languages,
                  translation is a skill all of its own. Professional
                  translators and interpreters adhere to ethical guidelines for
                  the field of interpretation, such as confidentiality and
                  translating accurately without personal bias.

                  which helps to ensure that they have the translation skills

                  are not likely to receive any training or evaluation of their
                  translation skills before being used to translate materials.
                  This puts undue burden on the bilingual staff to perform
                  beyond the scope of their knowledge and expertise. They may
                  feel pressured to do the translations on behalf of their own
                  communities even though those communities would best be served
                  by professional translators.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Humans also have limitations in their knowledge of different
                  languages. There are certainly some polyglots who know more
                  than a couple of languages, but no one can store the hundreds
                  of different languages that exist in our world. Each time a
                  museum wants to offer their content in additional languages,
                  they have to find a new translator which will double the costs
                  discussed above. To offer live programs like tours, museums
                  may have to hire another staff member who is able to speak
                  that language. These human resource costs add to the overall
                  difficulties of a museum to provide interpreted information to
                  their visitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Human translation of written text also requires another
                  limited resource in museums, time. Generally, a translator
                  works on about 2000-2500 words per day. That is equivalent to
                  about 15 labels of 150 words. In a large exhibit, it could
                  take weeks to get all of the text translated. Because the
                  wording of labels may be edited multiple times throughout
                  development of an exhibit or program, that means that the
                  translator will need to return to edit sections they already
                  completed. If there are last minute edits to the original
                  text, those changes need to be reflected in the translation
                  and this could lead to delays in production if the translator
                  is not given enough time to complete the changes and lead to a
                  lesser quality of translation. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Avantpage 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Avantpage. “How To Not Save Money On Your Translation

                  increase the cost of the overall project.

                  With the limitations of human translators and the strain that
                  translation can put on resources, finding solutions to these
                  problems is imperative for museums to be able to offer
                  materials and programs in multiple languages. Translation
                  technology has existed for decades and continues to improve.
                  It may offer a solution to many of the obstacles that prevent
                  museums from presenting information in multiple languages to
                  their guests.

                <h3>Introduction to Machine Translation</h3>
                <p>
                  While ideas of how to easily translate between two languages
                  had existed for a long time, the first use of machine
                  translation can be dated back to 1933 when French scientist
                  George Artsrouni patented his idea for a mechanical
                  translation device which he called the “mechanical brain.”

                  tape that was meant to help retrieve stored information

                  word-for-word translations. He first successfully demonstrated
                  the device in 1937. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Akbari 2014</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Akbari, Alireza. “An Overall Perspective of Machine

                  World War II spurred on translation technology research by the
                  military and by the 1950s, multiple universities had begun
                  research on mechanical translation including Massachusetts
                  Institute of Technology (MIT), University of Washington
                  Seattle, and University of California Los Angeles. MIT hosted
                  the first conference on machine translation in 1952. The field
                  continued to grow slowly from there over the next few decades
                  as it was difficult and costly to research. In the late 1980s,
                  IBM researchers published an article about statistical
                  approaches that led to increasing the power of computers and
                  the capacity of their memory as well as decreasing costs. This
                  helped researchers develop a new “example based” approach to
                  translation. This new statistical technique “translates the
                  phrase and words based on earlier translated texts.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Sreelekha 2016, 234-235</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Sreelekha, S. “A Survey Report on Evolution of Machine

                  During the 21<sup>st</sup> century, translation tools have
                  continued to improve rapidly. The early online translation
                  tools used the phrase-based statistical methods developed in
                  the 1980s. Today, many of the most common machine translation
                  tools–including the most popular tool Google Translate (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Elliot 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Elliott, Christopher. “The Best Translation Apps and

                  translation (NMT). NMT has faster, more accurate translations
                  than the previous types of machine translations. Rather than
                  translating a word or phrase individually, NMT produces
                  translations of whole sentences by pulling from data sets and
                  language modeling to better understand the context of the
                  whole text. This creates a more human-like quality to the
                  translations.

                <h3>Machine Translation, a Fix?</h3>
                <p>
                  Machine translation tools are able to address some of the
                  biggest limitations of human translators. For museums that
                  have limited budgets or resources, machine translators are a
                  cost saving measure. There are many free text machine
                  translators such as the most popular one, Google Translate.
                  Machine Translators can translate into hundreds of different
                  languages and dialects, so museums are able to provide
                  materials in many languages without raising the cost of
                  translation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Machine translation tools are also much quicker than human
                  translators. Machine translation only takes a matter of
                  seconds rather than days or weeks. Machine translation tools
                  are available all day, every day which allows for last minute
                  changes to be made to the text in exhibits or promotional
                  materials without a delay.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With all of the benefits of machine translation, it would seem
                  to be the ideal tool for museums, but one of the biggest
                  limitations of machine translation is accuracy. While NMT has
                  greatly improved the quality of translation compared with
                  previous translation tools, it still does not provide the same
                  understanding of language as a human translator.

                  understanding of the different variations of words is limited
                  to those included in the training. It also struggles with
                  expressions. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Zhang 2022, 179</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Zhang, Hong. “Comparison between Human Translation and

                  figure of speech rather than the individual words. NMT is
                  unsuccessful in understanding and transforming the expression
                  into an equivalent meaning in the target language. NMT is
                  attempting to copy the human thinking process, but still has a
                  long way to go. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Zhang 2022, 180</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Zhang, Hong. “Comparison between Human Translation and

                <p>
                  In addition to its inaccuracy, machine translation is only as
                  good as the data it was trained on. NMT falls victim to a
                  problem with many forms of artificial intelligence with
                  limited data sets: bias. Nearly 30% of text on the internet is
                  in English, so the tools have plenty of material to pull from
                  for English translations. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Che Wai Peh 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Che Wei Peh, Clara. “Is AI Generating an ‘Averaged’,

                  for machines to be able to pull from which can make the
                  translations even more inaccurate. The translations may even
                  be inappropriate or offensive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These two issues balance out the benefits of machine
                  translation. An inaccurate translation can have detrimental
                  results. Without someone who speaks the target language to
                  review the translations, museums risk insulting their visitors
                  and making them feel unwelcome or unwanted which goes against
                  the goals of introducing translated materials. However, this
                  does not mean that machine translation should be totally
                  eliminated. Museums can hire human translation editors to
                  review the machine translated materials for less than the cost
                  of a full translation which would help to address the major
                  concerns of NMT. Another form of machine translation that is
                  gaining popularity is computer-aided translation (CAT). CAT is
                  a type of software that reduces the work of human translators.
                  They include different tools that speed up the process like
                  translation memory. Essentially translation memory pulls from
                  the work that a human translator has already completed. Say a
                  sentence or phrase is used multiple times in a project, the
                  computer will save the translation and apply it to the later
                  uses in the project. With time saved by the translator, money
                  and resources are also saved by the museum. The discount can
                  range from around 5% to 25% depending on the company and the
                  repetitions used in the project.

                  solution, but it can help to reduce the overall costs for
                  museums.

                  a live tour with a docent, they need to be able to listen and
                  speak the language of the staff member or the staff member
                  needs to speak the visitor’s language. For live programs,

                  enunciation for accurate translations which creates a stunted,
                  unnatural speech pattern. The devices are only able to be used
                  in a visitor’s right ear and cannot comfortably be used on the
                  left which could be a problem for visitors with limited
                  hearing in one ear.

                  The United States Capitol in Washington, DC is providing tours
                  in Spanish and Mandarin using a Travis the Translator device.
                  The Capitol offers the language tours once a day in the
                  morning. The Capitol Visitor Center’s website does not provide
                  as much information about their device as the Tenement Museum.
                  It only says that “guides lead the tour with a translation
                  device.”(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">US Capitol 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. “Foreign Language Tours.”

                  about the tours in English, Spanish, and Mandarin while the
                  Tenement Museum only provides the information on their tours
                  on their website in English. Unlike the Ambassador, it does
                  not require a separate user device like a phone or tablet to
                  be usable. The device is able to be used on its own and can be
                  played out loud for visitors to listen or can be with the
                  microphone and assisted listening devices the Capitol uses for
                  its standard English tours. The device allows for translation
                  to and from both the language of the guide and the language of
                  the visitor, so visitors are able to ask questions while on
                  tour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my experience as a tour guide at the Capitol Visitor
                  Center, the tours I have led at the Capitol have had many of
                  the same problems as the Tenement Museum. The Travis device is
                  unable to keep up with human speech in real time unless the
                  speaker uses short, simple sentences. The Travis device can
                  take a few seconds to load and produce the target language
                  which means the speaker must wait for the processing to
                  complete before being able to continue speaking. The
                  translations are not always accurate or lack nuance which
                  leads to confusion among visitors. For example, when speaking
                  about a statue of the Ponca leader Chief Standing Bear
                  recently, the device translated his name as “jefe oso de pie”
                  or “boss bear standing.” Visitors then asked where the bear
                  was held in the Capitol. I do not speak fluent Spanish and
                  have no knowledge of Mandarin, so I am unable to recognize
                  when the translations are not correct unless a visitor
                  communicated confusion. A Spanish speaking tour guide would
                  have been able to better explain that the phrase was his name
                  and title rather than referring to a literal bear.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Devices like the Ambassador Interpreter and Travis the
                  Translator rely on the same NMT systems as text translations,
                  so they are subject to the same problems and more.
                  Additionally, voice translation devices require speech
                  recognition and speech synthesis software to work. This leads
                  to more systems that can produce errors. For example, the
                  Travis device registered me saying “that man” as “Batman” on
                  one of my tours and translated it as such. With text
                  translations, museums are able to edit materials before
                  presenting them to the public, but with live translations
                  there is no quality assurance testing. Until the technology
                  improves, hiring presenters who can speak the target language
                  still seems to be the best option for live programs.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                  Translation technology can address some of the issues that
                  acts as a barrier for museums, but the technology still needs
                  to improve before it can replace the human element that
                  language requires. The translation field continues to be
                  improved every day, so it may not be long until it is able to
                  equal human translations, but in the meantime, it can still be
                  used as a tool to assist people. Computer Assisted Translation
                  can help reduce the cost of text translations. Although voice
                  translation devices may not be ideal for translating entire
                  programs, they could be utilized for visitors to ask questions
                  as they navigate museums. Until the technology improves,
                  museums should continue to invest in making their content
                  accessible to all.

                  The <em>Doron Sebbag Art Collection</em> was established in
                  Tel Aviv at the beginning of the 1990s by Doron Sebbag, a
                  passionate art connoisseur. It comprises over 1,200 Israeli
                  and international contemporary artworks in assorted media. The
                  original statement of the Collection declared by the first
                  collection’s curator, Dr. Aya Lurie was: “The two major values
                  that have guided Sebbag as a collector throughout the years
                  are the decision to purchase and present contemporary Israeli
                  and international art side by side, and the decision to expose
                  the collection to the public through exhibitions.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Lurie 2000</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Lurie, Aya. 2000. “Forward.” In

                  During these almost three decades of extensive activity, works
                  from the Collection were on loan to museums in Israel and
                  abroad, and diverse theme exhibitions have been staged, some
                  in public museums or institutions, and some in private spaces.
                  The Collection has never had a permanent physical exhibition
                  space, and over the years, its staff has remained small,
                  ranging from one person responsible for curating, and
                  day-to-day operations, to up to four individuals during
                  special events. For many years, the artworks have been
                  accessible to the public only during exhibitions periods or
                  through loans. During the last decade, the Collection’s
                  activities were broadened and various initiatives took place,
                  consisting of collaborations with different institutions, some
                  private, and some cultural and educational. For example, one
                  of the main projects from the Collection was a collaboration
                  with local artists at a private boutique hotel in Tel Aviv
                  (<em>ARTIST</em> Hotel), owned by the collector. As part of
                  the hotel renovation, the chosen artists produced a
                  site-specific art piece for the hotel rooms and corridors.

                <h2>Private Art Collections in Israel</h2>
                <p>
                  To gain a comprehensive understanding of the Collection’s
                  historical context from a decade ago, I would like to
                  incorporate insights from the Israeli art scene, with a
                  particular focus on the art market, private collectors, and
                  their impact. In her research “Bringing Collectors of Israeli
                  Art from the Dark” (2022), Milly Perry analyzes the phenomenon
                  of collecting Israeli art in Israel and notes that the Israeli
                  art market is small and limited, managed by a small group of
                  influential collectors in Israel, including Doron Sebbag,
                  several leading gallery owners, museum directors and curators
                  of Israeli art and an auction house. The extent and nature of
                  their influence and interrelations change in correlation with
                  the period and the composition of the community active in the
                  field at the time. Her study thus supports the conclusion that
                  the collectors’ role and standing are important and
                  influential concerning how art history is created in Israel
                  and that in certain cases, they even shape the future of the
                  art ecosystem and the art market in Israel. In addition, she
                  focuses on the processes of globalization in the art world and
                  the integration of Israeli artists into the global art world,
                  as the ties between galleries and collectors. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Perry 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Perry, Milly. 2023.

                <h2>Establishing a new collection website</h2>
                <p>
                  As both the manager and the Collection’s curator from 2008 to
                  2023 (started as the assistant curator to curator Dr. Aya
                  Lurie until the year 2010), I held responsibility for the
                  online presence of the Collection, which was established in
                  2013. The need for a website derived from the willingness of
                  the collector, Mr. Sebbag, to expose the vast activities, and
                  to brand the collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When establishing a website for a private art collection,
                  numerous factors had to be carefully considered, primarily
                  revolving around the balance between the collector’s desire to
                  expose the Collection’s activities without sharing the
                  artworks as open access. I needed to respect the collector’s
                  wish for discretion. The Collection is private and, unlike the
                  museum’s public collections, there was no obligation to
                  operate like a public museum. Therefore, the artwork’s
                  database was documented in a separate
                  <a href="#page-https-www-collectorsystems-com-index-htm" target="_blank">cloud-based collection management software</a>, used for our internal use, with the option to access only
                  with a password.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The work on the website lasted about a year and a half. My
                  research during this period encompassed various aspects,
                  starting from the archival research, until the final design.
                  The inspiration for creating the online web stemmed from
                  research into private art collections and museum websites and
                  professional reviews of these times. My research, conducted in
                  collaboration with my assistant Donna Polack, primarily delved
                  into the historical materials and archives of the collection,
                  encompassing various aspects such as support history, loans,
                  publications, and exhibitions. I started to work on the online
                  website after the end of a critical point, when an exhibition
                  I co-curated with curator Tal Yahas was held outside of a
                  museum, in a private art institution, for the first time.

                  serve as a foundation for the creation of a website, with a
                  focus on highlighting the collection’s activities and its
                  innovative approach:

                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The collection expresses Sebbag’s attempt to comprehend,
                    identify, and decode - from a large selection of
                    contemporary artworks - those that reflect the zeitgeist and
                    the constantly evolving culture. Hence, the collection
                    functions as an active organism in a never-ending process of
                    becoming; it is an infinite pursuit of an object of desire
                    by someone who enjoys the search and research, who
                    vigorously follows new, dynamic approaches in art, trying to
                    pinpoint, in advance, the cultural heroes of the future. The
                    exhibition enables examination of the metamorphoses of the
                    collection as a life’s work, a type of time travel into the
                    depths of the evolving contemporary culture, on which Sebbag
                    takes us, against the backdrop of an atmosphere of
                    apocalypse, as if he were asking himself what he has formed
                    thus far, but also - what is the essence that he takes with
                    him, into the future.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Golan Miller 2012</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Golan Miller, Dana. <em>A Collection’s Evolution</em>.

                  After mentioning the art scene atmosphere in Israel and the
                  Collection’s activity, it can be seen that during this period,
                  the primary aim was to focus on Doron Sebbag as a collector,
                  the Collection’s accomplishments, and to emphasize the vast
                  activities. In other words: create a ‘business card’ for the
                  collection and brand it. The purpose was to engage with
                  researchers in Israel, as well as abroad, curators, and art
                  collectors. This process involved assessing how much the
                  collector aimed to establish connections or affiliations with
                  the local artistic canon versus his aspiration to be part of
                  the global private art collections. Using the English language
                  was part of the aim of trying to show that we are In Israel,
                  but we also have a global orientation (figures 1 and 2).

                  inspiration. We looked especially at the
                  <em>UBS art collection</em>, A New York established bank, that
                  has a vast contemporary art collection, and at that time, was

                    to differentiate themselves from the competition and to
                    attract non-expert audiences, art museums have to pay more
                    attention to creating a strong brand. Museum brand is
                    becoming a sign of a quality museum’s distinctiveness and
                    attractiveness… with a strong brand identity, art museums
                    can improve their ability to promote exhibitions and perform
                    other tasks connected to their integral core elements and
                    long-term objectives… In smaller organizations, in
                    particular, the museum’s manager, curator, or founder can
                    project their own personal characteristics and artistic
                    taste onto the museum. In addition to direct use value, the
                    non-use benefits are many, especially the museum’s role in
                    heritage transfer to future generations, and in advancing
                    the stock of intellectual capital - important for art and

                    relationship marketing and interactions with customers…
                    Network associations abroad, experimental relationships
                    with, and direct marketing to, consumers, together with new,

                  another field - press, where we inserted scanned articles from
                  the press about the collection (fig. 5). We used
                  <em>WordPress</em>, and most of the documents were inserted in
                  PDF formats after professional scanning.

                  When we launched the website at the end of 2013, I felt a
                  sense of satisfaction. It may have been different from the
                  websites of the world’s largest private art collectors, but it
                  served as an excellent platform to showcase our identity,
                  introduce Doron Sebbag, and highlight our achievements in the
                  art scene. These navigation fields still exist today.
                </p>
                <h2>2013 - 2023 – website updates</h2>
                <p>
                  A lot happened throughout that period, concerning private art
                  collecting. One of the recent searches of art collectors
                  conducted by
                  <a href="#page-https-www-tandfonline-com-author-rojas-2c-fabio" target="_blank">Fabio Rojas</a>&nbsp;&amp;
                  <a href="#page-https-www-tandfonline-com-author-lista-2c-peter" target="_blank">Peter Lista</a>
                  (2022) defined that collecting reflects personal identities
                  and the collector’s position in a globalized art world. This
                  study “focuses on the collector’s trajectory through the art
                  world and the overlapping pulls of status and community. As
                  the art world expands through the proliferation of art fairs,
                  social media, and online art sales portals, it will be
                  important to understand the lives of collectors as individuals
                  moving through a social world and not just as provider of
                  capital.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Rojas and Lista 2022, 98</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Rojas, Fabio, and Peter Lista. 2022.

                  During that decade, I fulfilled many daily operations roles in
                  the Collection and had no time to update the website. This is
                  sometimes the case with small museums. Luna Leoni and Matteo
                  Cristofaro claim (2022), that sometimes small museums are
                  afraid of adopting new technologies mainly because of the
                  risks and investments in terms of time, and human and
                  financial resources. But, they also claim that the most used
                  technologies by small museums are the website, online presence
                  on non-proprietary channels, and social media; and that public
                  and private small museums have an equal level of technology
                  adoption. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Luna and Matteo 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Leoni, Luna, and Cristofaro Matteo. 2021. “To Adopt or

                  As for the website, during this decade, I kept updating the
                  basic information: for each exhibition, I provided the same
                  materials - JPEG images, text, and a PDF version of the new
                  catalog we produced for each exhibition (we used
                  <em>WordPress</em> and kept it). I added very few ideas that
                  were more accessible, such as
                  <a href="#page-https-my-matterport-com-show-m-wgwv6hybkp5-and-play-1-and-hr-1-and-mt-1-and-hl-2-and-help-0" target="_blank">a virtual tour of the <em>Artist</em> Hotel</a>, and
                  <a href="#page-https-www-orscollection-com-about" target="_blank">a Hebrew text about Doron Sebbag</a>. In addition, for the latest exhibition,
                  <a href="#page-https-www-orscollection-com-exhibition-if-we-come-closer" target="_blank"><em>if we come closer</em></a>
                  to the year 2022, I added audio files to express the
                  exhibition idea. But still, the appearance stayed the same as
                  in the Year 2013.

                <h2>Thinking about how to engage, how to better access.</h2>
                <p>
                  In his ‘Oral History of Museum Computing’ Paul Marty discusses
                  his own story related to the changes in technology and their
                  influence on the works of the staff. In the end, he summarizes
                  that:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    To wrap up our entire history of technology in museums, the
                    technology changes so much faster than society does, and how
                    do we keep our norms, our ethics, our laws, our legal
                    practices moving along with our technology and how hard that
                    is. But it speaks again to the value of technology and
                    museums for effecting change in the world, for building
                    broader communities online, and in person, building empathy,
                    and emphasizing our shared humanity. My argument always has
                    been that the more we can do to do broader outreach, to get
                    museums to present their information to our broader
                    community, the better off we’re going to be in general.

                  If I were to embark on recreating a new online website and
                  digitalization setup today, I would reflect on the sources of
                  my inspiration and explore more innovative approaches for
                  accessing the Collection. How might I emphasize the vast
                  activities of three decades and stay updated?&nbsp; Additionally,
                  how can I promote connectivity, foster dialogue, and reorient
                  it toward engagement on many levels? Since the Collection is
                  not an open-source access database, how can I find a creative
                  solution to expose some of the works?

                  When looking at some websites of private contemporary art
                  collections for inspiration, there are three in mind. One of
                  the examples can be shown in the
                  <em>Broad Foundation.</em> (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">The Broad</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">The Broad. “The Broad Digital.” Accessed November 4th,

                  Allison Schoen mentioned the <em>Broad</em> Private Foundation
                  as a good example of “providing education and access to
                  contemporary art for students.” She also noted that “Founders
                  of contemporary private museums possess the influence and
                  opportunity to create new models of museum experiences
                  further. While each museum carries out its mission
                  differently, each of the founders creates a positive impact on
                  their community.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Schoen 2022, v</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Schoen, Allison. 2022.

                  With that in mind, I will list some ideas, to align with the
                  purpose that I think should be the most important - how to
                  access, engage, and present the art Collection in a new way,
                  and show its history in a new light. Of course, more budget or
                  stuff is needed to operate it. But it can definitely be
                  produced with the right programming and a defined time slot.

                      in a much more appealing and interactive appearance. Loans
                      should provide links to the institutions.

                      innovation, such as video and audio. For example, adding

                      Videos and Podcasts: produce a series of conversations
                      between artists from the collection, former curators of
                      the collection’s exhibition, and so on. Each reflects the
                      year that the work was purchased or the exhibition
                      produced with adding discussion such as ‘then and now’.
                      The Collection archive includes two filming interviews
                      with Sebbag, which were held by a media reporter. One way
                      to show them is by having a new interview today with
                      Sebbag, relating and reacting to them, with new comments
                      about the market then, compared to now. In that way, the
                      observer can learn about the collections from nowadays but
                      relate to today. Intellectual property confirmation is
                      needed in some cases, so it should be taken into account.
                      A good example can be seen in the
                      <em>Pinault Collection</em> in Venice (owned by
                      François-Henri Pinault, a French businessman), which has a
                      creatively designed way of showing Podcasts, but also
                      interviews and other videos.

                  At the last exhibition I co-curated with curator Ravit Harari
                  under the title
                  <a href="#page-https-www-orscollection-com-exhibition-if-we-come-closer" target="_blank"><em>If We Come Closer</em></a>
                  (2023), we worked with high school students, who interpreted
                  the artworks from the collection. We recorded their voices and
                  the visitors in the gallery heard them talking about the
                  artworks. We inset the digital and audio materials, but their
                  appearance on the website is not clear enough. It should
                  receive a better appearance and navigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The concept is to showcase a wide range of activities while
                  always considering how to engage with a broad audience,
                  starting from casual users and students of all levels to
                  professionals. This approach ensures that the art collection
                  not only appeals to individuals but also serves as an
                  interactive digital platform.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  The Doron Sebbag Art Collection website still exists and
                  serves as the primary destination for those wishing to explore
                  the Collection further. The ideas mentioned are just the
                  beginning of a new approach to reorganizing it with a fresher,
                  more appealing appearance. Only lately, when I came to the US
                  to study on museums and engagement in-depth, I realized how
                  important it is, to any museum. The Doron Sebbag Art
                  Collection, as in the case of other private collections, can
                  be viewed as a small museum. This paper was written in an
                  attempt to convey the idea that private collectors with
                  extensive collections should focus more on engagement and
                  accessibility. It took more than a decade to fully grasp the
                  validity of this point. Contemporary art collections and small
                  museums, should undoubtedly utilize the current digital
                  accessibility opportunities and include it in their yearly
                  budget and it can definitely be affordable. I hope that this
                  paper serves as an example of an oral history project that
                  includes inner reflection and will prove beneficial also for
                  me if I find myself working on a website project in the
                  future.

                  Video games have gone from a small niche in the entertainment
                  sector to a cultural mainstay alongside film and literature in
                  just a few decades. For the purpose of this paper video games
                  include arcade games with their own standalone cabinets, games
                  played on both at home consoles and personal computers, and
                  mobile games played on the phone. In 2021, the video game
                  industry had an annual revenue of over 214 billion dollars, a
                  number that is predicted to continue to rise in coming years.

                  world cannot be ignored or denied. Given this significance, it
                  makes sense that video games would be represented in museums.
                  They also can unlock new opportunities for engagement and
                  outreach that would have been out of reach without the
                  influence of video games. Different museums approach having
                  video games in their collection in a variety of ways,
                  <em>The Museum of Modern Art</em> (<em>MOMA</em>) incorporates
                  them into their galleries, while the
                  <em>Coputerspielemuseum</em> and the
                  <em>Strong Museum of Play</em> have recreated arcades or other
                  themed spaces for some of the games that they have on display.
                  The approaches vary based on the hardware and requirements of
                  the game themselves, as well as what the museums are trying to
                  convey by displaying them and how interactive they want them
                  to be.

                  Video games have value in museums in multiple respects. One of
                  the things that make video games stand out from other artistic
                  mediums is their inherent interactivity. Video games are meant
                  to be played;, they take the player and make them a part of
                  the story. Because of this, in order toto be best represented
                  in a museum, video games should be playable to some degree.
                  Video games are meant to be played, they bring people in on
                  the experience and make their choices matter. While museums
                  have made strides in increasing interactives in exhibits and
                  museum programming, the fact that video games are made to be
                  interacted with encourages further engagement from visitors.
                  When interviewed about the museum’s Video Game Lab as Video
                  Game Curator for the
                  <em>Australian Center for the Moving Image</em>, Video Game
                  Curator Arieh Offman, said describes, “And it is this
                  interactivity that is the crux of what makes games so
                  appealing – you are not just watching or listening to stories
                  but become part of them. You control the characters, you make
                  the choices –they become your victories and your defeats, and
                  the sense of achievement that a player feel is unique to the
                  medium of videogames.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">ACMI 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Curating Our Centrepiece Exhibition. ACMI. Accessed

                  stand out from other forms of media. However, there are
                  complications in having playable video games as a part of a
                  museum collection, because of hardware and software
                  limitations. Every playable game requires its own console or
                  other device to be run on, in addition to controllers,
                  displays, and of course copies of the game’s code. Museums
                  would either need to limit the number of visitors who can
                  participate at once, acquire multiple copies of the necessary
                  hardware and software, or engage with emulators. The Museum of
                  Modern Art has a variety of video games in its collection,
                  ranging from staples of the industry like <em>Pac Man</em>, to
                  independently made games like <em>Getting Over It</em>.

                  acquisition stage by ensuring that they also acquire the code
                  for any games that they acquire in their original language so
                  that they can be better preserved, even if the physical media
                  fails, or if the game, console, or controller is too fragile
                  to be interacted with regularly by visitors. They also use a
                  case-by-case basis for how interactive they have the games on
                  display be. Games that can be played in their entirety in a
                  short time are available to be played as is, while longer or
                  more complex games have smaller sections able to be played
                  <em>MOMA</em> also uses emulators in cases where the physical
                  media on which the game is stored is too fragile to be used.

                  unofficial, and thus would call legal issues if they were a
                  part of a museum collection without proper licensing.

                  In addition to MOMA, there are other museums that have already
                  integrated video games as a part of their exhibitions, and in
                  some cases are in large part dedicated to collecting and
                  exhibiting video games and related media. One of the museums
                  most focused on video games is the
                  <em>Coputerspielemuseum</em> in Berlin, Germany.

                  their exhibits allow visitors to interact with and play some
                  of the games in the museum’s collection. For example, one of
                  their current exhibitions is called “<em>Impact Games</em>”
                  the exhibit has several reconstructed spaces showing how video
                  games of different eras were played at the time. These include
                  a recreated arcade and living room to represent the 1970s,
                  when games first started to appear in homes, and bedrooms for
                  the 1980s and 1990s. The goal of this exhibit is for visitors
                  to see the development of video games over time, and how they
                  were perceived and played by people at the time.

                  that they came from, they work to recontextualize them for
                  younger people. Beyond that, the
                  <em>Coputerspielemuseum</em> also has art installation based
                  around video games, including a giant controller for a
                  Nintendo console that requires multiple visitors to work
                  together to play and a specially modified pong table which
                  punishes players when their opponent scores a point.

                  The <em>Coputerspielemuseum’s</em> collection of video games,
                  and related media is extensive, with over 35,000 storage
                  devices containing video games software, 350 consoles and
                  computers for playing the games, and 12,000 magazines. Their
                  games are all stored in their original form, with no mention
                  of emulators or similarly copied or reproduced games. They
                  have also participated in projects to further research in the
                  preservation of digital media. The
                  <em>Coputerspielemuseum</em> not only has an impressive
                  collection of video games, gaming hardware, and related media,
                  but also shows dedication to having the games remain playable
                  and interactive for visitors.

                  The <em>Strong Museum of Play</em> is another museum with a
                  focus on video games. They hold the
                  <em>International Center for the History of Online Games,</em>
                  the <em>World Video Game Hall of Fame,</em> a Video Game Play
                  Capture Project, and many permanent and temporary exhibits
                  that are dedicated to video games.

                  and their development, some are games made purposely for the
                  museum to be interactive elements for exhibits, and others are
                  dedicated to a single game, its development, art style, and
                  the story behind it.

                  One of these is a permanent exhibit dedicated to the game
                  series <em>Age of Empires</em>, a game series for the PC that
                  falls under the category of RTS, or real time strategy. The
                  game has players select an empire from various points in
                  history and compete against another set of empires controlled
                  by other players, or the computer. Players must build up an
                  economy to unlock new technologies, create a powerful
                  military, and defeat their opponents. There have been four
                  games in the main franchise, with one spinoff titled
                  <em>Age of Mythology</em>. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Age of Empires 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Age of Empires Franchise - Official Web Site.” Age of

                  history of the games’ developer, an area with a throne where
                  visitors can take a picture like they are leaders of their own
                  empires, concept art of the games, a playable version of the
                  original <em>Age of Empires</em>, and interactives and
                  displays that go over how the developers incorporated history
                  into the games and how it influenced gameplay. This exhibit
                  explores every aspect of the game, not only allowing visitors
                  to play, but also presenting various stages of the game’s
                  development process, and the people who worked on it. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Age of Empires, The Strong National Museum of Play

                  people who play the games are not normally privy to. The
                  <em>Age of Empires</em> exhibit is designed in a way where
                  visitors can not only interact with the game itself but also
                  get a look at how it was made and what choices went into those
                  decisions. While most other exhibits dedicated to games seem
                  more focused on broader categories of games, the
                  <em>Age of Empires</em> exhibit is an excellent example of how
                  to highlight the development and story of one game franchise
                  in particular.

                  The <em>Strong Museum of Play</em> also has an exhibit similar
                  to the Coputerspielemuseum’s <em>Impact Play</em> called
                  <em>EGame Revolution</em>, which focuses on having video games
                  from every generation to play though. This includes a large
                  arcade space with over 48 arcade cabinet style games, home
                  consoles with playable games ranging from Nintendo’s
                  <em>N64</em> to <em>Sony’s PlayStation 3</em>, as well as
                  unique games, such as an oversized version of <em>Tetris</em>.

                  to see the progression of games over time, as previously
                  mentioned when discussing the
                  <em>Coputerspielemuseum’s</em> collection,
                  <em>eGame Revolution</em>, and exhibits like it also allow for
                  visitors to access a catalog of games that they would
                  otherwise not get to see or play, especially in one place. The
                  exhibit also discusses how video games evolved, and how they
                  changed the way that people play.

                  Along with their video game collections like
                  <em>eGame Revolution</em>, the <em>Strong Museum</em> also has
                  a large collection of video games in storage. As with any
                  museum, only a small portion of their collection can be on
                  display at a time, and the <em>Strong Museum</em> is not
                  solely dedicated to video games, so that collection can only
                  take up a certain amount of space on the museum floor. But
                  this collection still serves as a valuable academic resource,
                  through the museum’s website, researchers can request to visit
                  the museum in order to schedule a visit to the museum’s
                  <em>International Center for the History of Electronic
                    Games</em>
                  where they can play games in the collection on-site.

                  Older video games are a storage and preservation concern for
                  museums collecting video games. Floppy disks, which contain
                  may older PC games, have an expected shelf life of 10-20
                  years, and CDs and DVDs, which were the main medium for PC and
                  console games following the floppy disk era, have a listed
                  life span of between 2-25 years depending on how they are
                  stored. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Arcserve 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Arcserve. “Data Storage Lifespans: How Long Will Media

                  physical hardware, it also applies to digital colonies of
                  games and their marketplaces. Many consoles have their own
                  digital stores that have gone through multiple iterations,
                  removing older games as they go. Meanwhile PC games are sold
                  across multiple marketplaces, leaving more room for
                  redundancy, but there are still cases where games are lost,
                  and only those that exist on a hard drive or disk somewhere
                  remain. These losses can be accidental, with updated versions
                  not being supported or a developer going under and no longer
                  being able to sell the game, or intentional, as there are
                  cases where for various reasons, developers have intentionally
                  made games unavailable after their release.

                  One of the most famous examples of a video game being
                  intentionally removed from all digital marketplaces was a
                  game, or trailer for a game, called *P.T.*This game was
                  actually a trailer for a game that was never released, the
                  name was an abbreviation of Playable Trailer. It was set to be
                  the next installment in the <em>Silent Hill</em> franchise of
                  horror games. The trailer consisted of a player walking
                  through the same house in a loop. As the loop went on, the
                  house got more decrepit, and more noises and scary imagery was
                  put in until eventually a ghost would appear and kill the
                  player. The game was set to have big names attached, at the
                  end of <em>P.T.</em> It is revealed that the character the
                  player controls is based on Norman Reedus, an actor famous for
                  his role on The Walking Dead. Hideo Kojima, a famous game
                  developer, and the director Guillermo Del Toro were also set
                  to work on the game. Unfortunately, Kojima had a falling out
                  with the developer <em>Konami,</em> the game was cancelled,
                  and <em>P.T.</em> was removed from all online game stores.
                  Some copies do survive. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Simelane 2019</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Simelane, Smangaliso. The Legend of P.T.: Kojima’s

                  it off their systems, or it would be lost forever. Some copies
                  survive to this day, one of which is in the
                  <em>Strong Museum of Play’s</em> collection. The interest
                  built around this game came in part from the big names working
                  on it, and the excitement of a new installment of a fan
                  favorite franchise like <em>Silent Hill,</em> but also because
                  it was unique. Although game demos were not a new idea,
                  <em>P.T.</em> was made and presented in a different way. Most
                  demos were a level or two pulled from the game, but
                  <em>P.T.</em> was as its name described, a trailer; it was its
                  own self-contained content that just hinted at the story of
                  the now lost <em>Silent Hills</em> –– a fully interactive hook
                  to get people to want more. The trailer made the player a part
                  of the story before the game was even out. The case of
                  <em>P.T.</em> reflects why it is so important to preserve the
                  interactive aspect of video games in museums, and how
                  essential it is to fully engage with them.

                  Museums that display video games and have them available for
                  interaction by visitors have different methods of access and
                  what versions are displayed. Some museums, like
                  <em>MOMA</em> not only do things on a case-by-case basis, but
                  also create a smaller build or one manufactured to recreate a
                  massive multiplayer environment, as they did with
                  <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>.

                  when it comes to home console and PC games, there are other
                  issues encountered. As original hardware fails, having games,
                  especially older or rare ones on display for public use
                  greatly increases the risk that they can be lost forever.
                  Emulation is one method to ensure that the game can be
                  preserved or displayed beyond its original hardware, but it is
                  frowned upon by the gaming industry. There have not been any
                  legal cases regarding creation of emulators of games that are
                  owned by the creator, but when it comes to the distribution of
                  emulated games, especially online, charges of piracy come into
                  play. Museums collecting video games are able to create
                  emulations and recreations of games they own, though they can
                  also work with developers to do this, but they cannot make
                  them available online. This differs somewhat from the trend of
                  digitization across the museum world, but where a painting or
                  other form of more traditional art can have the rights
                  regarding its online publication transferred to a museum when
                  it is donated, unless a game is donated by a developer and
                  consents, the same cannot be done for video games. This makes
                  the <em>Strong Museum’s</em> collection’s availability for
                  research access even more valuable.

                  Video games are an extremely varied medium that has expanded
                  from a small niche in entertainment to a mainstay, a
                  multibillion-dollar industry with countless titles released
                  every single year. It is understandable that video games have
                  an established presence in museums, from museums dedicated to
                  video games to larger institutions that acquire them as a part
                  of their collections. The innate interactivity of video games
                  creates challenges and opportunities for their display. By
                  design, video games draw the viewer, the player, in, and make
                  them a part of the art and the story being told. They draw
                  visitors in for an utterly unique experience. They also can be
                  used to make unique art installations based around the games,
                  from oversized games that require cooperation, or something
                  totally new like <em>Coputerspielemuseum’s</em>

                  challenges in regard to preservation. Many older games are
                  long past their expected shelf life and having them available
                  for play puts them at increased risk of damage. Emulation is
                  one method of further preserving and increasing availability
                  of video game collections. As video games continue to be a
                  part of museum collections, they will be used in new and
                  interesting ways of expanding interactivity, and new solutions
                  for preservation will be developed.

                  During my internship at the Smithsonian Museum Support center
                  earlier this Summer, I began working on a provenance project
                  that involved organizing information, reviewing texts, and
                  searching documents to discern if a collection of objects was
                  either a loan or a donation. After eight weeks, I produced a
                  final report and a final file index to support my findings and
                  suggestions. During my Fall semester, the opportunity arose to
                  research artificial intelligence (AI) this year; I wondered
                  how this technology could support provenance research
                  workflows, speeding up the process of determining ownership
                  and clearing up issues of intellectual property. My research
                  included understanding how AI functions, recognizing the
                  associated risks of AI, and conceptulaizing how AI would
                  support provenance researchers. I initially found AI to be
                  overwhelmingly vast and intimidating; I am now excited to see
                  this tool become a reality for provenance researchers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are museums already employing AI for informative, and
                  analytical data processing. For example, as of 2020, the
                  American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York used
                  IBM’s Watson Natural Language Processor (NLP) and Google Cloud
                  NLP to assess visitor surveys after they visited AMNH and
                  reviews submitted through TripAdvisor to gauge visitor
                  experiences. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Murphy and Villaespesa 2020</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Murphy, Oonagh, and Elena Villaespesa.

                  process for use. My technological AI experience is based on
                  research generated in the field, outside researchers using AI,
                  AI-focused news stories, and online contributors whose
                  specialty and focus is AI ethics.

                <h3><em>Bias</em></h3>
                <p>
                  AI bias occurs when the training data retains human biases and
                  responds with biased results.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Villaespesa and French 2019</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Villaespesa, Elena, and Ariana French. “AI, Visitor

                  also biased. AI outputs are biased if the programmer, creating
                  the AI algorithms used to generate data, has been inserting
                  their own biases into the mix.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Biddle 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Biddle, Sam. “The Internet’s New Favorite AI Proposes

                <p>
                  Given the complexity of human language, user error, data
                  sourcing by the software and the developer’s algorithms, AI
                  has been known to respond incorrectly to a researcher’s
                  prompts. Based on my personal experiments with ChatGPT, Claude
                  2, and Google Bard, the responses have been thorough and clear
                  but, there have been some errors (the application recommended
                  imaginary sources) mixed within the response for each of these
                  MLL applications. Using the Department of the Interior’s,
                  Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and the
                  United Nations Declaration of Indigenous People texts, I
                  prompted the various AI applications to answer questions
                  regarding museum repatriation based on the text. My
                  experiments provided insight into the need for proper staff
                  training when using these applications - I have never used AI
                  prior to writing this paper so the initial interaction was
                  interesting. Because I am familar with both documents, I was
                  able to determine the accuracy of the AI responses to my
                  experimental prompts.

                  information already on the web and AI reiterates what it sees
                  as truth; often occurring when AI uses the web to answer a
                  prompt. Another reason for inaccuracy is the predictive nature
                  of the software as the algorithm detects and produces patterns
                  in various ways. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Weise and Metz 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Weise, Karen, and Cade Metz. “When A.I. Chatbots

                <h3><em>Education</em></h3>
                <p>
                  With education and training in AI, abundant on the web,
                  museums should consider standardized training in use, as far
                  as provenance research is concerned so staff are prepared to
                  properly use the software to get the best result. Github and
                  OpenAI have resources to prepare museum staff but it would be
                  best to come to an agreement on what resources and authorities
                  should be involved in the process of training.

                  Smithsonian Institution supports documenting “how the AI

                  determines a means to expedite the process and deploys the
                  model for use within the provenance research workflow.
                  Workflows in museums should include a documented plan that
                  includes: strategy, project cycle, materials and AI

                <p>
                  Another provenance research use of AI is in the determination
                  for object repatriation for indigenous cultures for the
                  purposes of NAGPRA. Using AI for provenance determinations of
                  indigenous cultural property is not appropriate without a
                  conversation with the affected cultural group.

                  about different cultural positions regarding AI use. Using AI
                  in cases for determining and researching Indigenous cultures
                  should also be addressed in the museum’s ethical stewardship
                  policies within its collection management plan.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  Museums stand to benefit significantly as backlogs of
                  ownership investigations are resolved from AI-based provenance
                  research; collections become more available for exhibition,
                  study, and programming. AI-based provenance research could
                  positively impact collection object access by providing
                  provenance researchers a means of processing large amounts of
                  information in a shorter timeframes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As mentioned, AI technology contains risks that can negatively
                  affect a museum’s authority over its collection. Understanding
                  the AI project cycle is essential to identifying how the
                  different bias types are introduced can help provenance
                  researchers to avoid them. By proactively mitigating bias,
                  museums can confidently and openly use AI for provenance
                  research. Education and focused training in data creation and
                  LLM usage can help subvert most inaccurate AI outputs.
                  Transparently documenting AI use, auditing for biases,
                  controlling data inputs, and adhering to emerging best
                  practices around ethical AI development, improve AI models for
                  continued use for both the provenance researcher and the
                  museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  AI technology is rapidly evolving; museums can establish
                  responsible use by clearly defining project scopes, workflows,
                  and intended applications. AI is an incredibly intense and
                  intimidating application that could potentially hinder
                  productivity and result in faulty responses if not used
                  properly. Learning about the elements of AI in a group ensures
                  staff is on the same page for developing policies, training,
                  and ethical standards. Key terminology has been defined to
                  provide a means of navigating and encouraging discussions
                  regarding AI integration into a provenance workflow. The
                  ultimate goal for AI-based provenance research is developing a
                  technological tool that supports provenance researchers in
                  acquiring the information needed to make underdocumented
                  objects valued as educational tools for the public.

                        Within machine learning are four approaches to learning

                  More than simply buildings with exhibitions, museums seem to
                  have a specific cultural identity about them: marble columns,
                  grand atriums, security guards in every other room. But this
                  idea may not be entirely accurate anymore. As with nearly
                  everything in Western society, the internet has brought great
                  changes to the world of museums. Many major institutions have
                  at least partially digitized, publicly available collections;
                  museums have also adapted to innovations like social media to
                  further attendance. Alongside museums’ development in the
                  twenty-first century, video games have arisen as one of the
                  most popular art forms. Today, it seems impossible to walk
                  into a room of twelve-year-olds and not hear a mention of
                  Fortnite. Three games in particular–
                  <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em>,
                  <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em>, and <em>Dark Souls III</em>–
                  each show a potential example of video-game-as-museum. Through
                  video games, museums may well be able to find a path forward
                  in a rapidly changing, digitally-focused world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, however, it is important to define what a museum
                  actually is. This may seem simple at first, but it is a
                  deceptively difficult question. After all, what is it that
                  links a grand, national museum like the Smithsonians and a
                  tiny, one-room, community focused space like New York City’s
                  Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space? (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">MORUS</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">‘Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space.’ MORUS. Accessed

                    A museum is a not-for-profit, permanent institution in the

                    interprets and exhibits tangible and intangible heritage.
                    Open to the public, accessible and inclusive, museums foster

                    ethically, professionally and with the participation of
                    communities, offering varied experiences for education,
                    enjoyment, reflection and knowledge sharing.

                  Both of these definitions have problems, however. It is hard
                  to imagine a museum as innocuous as San Francisco’s
                  Exploratorium as an extension of state power; at the same time
                  the Exporatorium lacks traditional collections.<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Exploratorium</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">‘Exploratorium.’ Exploratorium.

                  Despite this, it seems fairly obvious that the Exploratorium
                  is, indeed, still a museum.

                  Janet Marstine posits a more nuanced approach to the question,
                  although perhaps not a satisfying one. To Marstine, there are
                  four grand metaphors that can apply to some museums: “shrine,
                  market-driven industry, colonizing space, and post-museum.”
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Marstine 2008, 8-9</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Marstine, Janet. 2008.

                      Newark: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated.</span></cite>) Shrine museums, similar to Duncan and Wallach’s definition,
                  serve as a shrine, or a space to worship something; an example
                  could be the National Museum of American History. While NMAH
                  does not give an uncritical view of this country’s past, it
                  still does serve to celebrate American history. Market-driven
                  museums, despite the somewhat condescending name, are museums
                  that seek to “‘give in’” to market demands, choosing to cater
                  to visitors instead of some lofty ideal of what a museum
                  should be. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Marstine 2008, 10</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Marstine, Janet. 2008.

                      Newark: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated.</span></cite>) Colonizing spaces, as the name suggests, are museums whose
                  collections are formed from the spoils of imperialism, using
                  the “‘other’ to construct and justify the ‘self.’” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Marstine 2008, 14</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Marstine, Janet. 2008.

                      Newark: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated.</span></cite>) The post museum is the least helpful metaphor for defining
                  museums, as it deals with the theoretical; it is a museum that
                  has transcended museums, serving less a repository for
                  knowledge and more as a way to better its community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, what is a museum? Well, it’s a space that, through one or
                  more of Marstine’s four metaphors, focuses on educating the
                  public about a specific topic, while often functioning as a
                  societal and social ritual. Some, like the British Museum, use
                  the excuse of public education to flaunt colonial plunder;
                  others, like the Exploratorium generally just want to teach
                  the public cool things about science. It is impossible to come
                  to a full definition, however. No matter how broad or specific
                  a definition is, there will always be spaces that fall outside
                  of it: are zoos and aquariums museums? Are libraries? There is
                  not, and will never be, a fully satisfactory definition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Defining video games is quite a bit easier: a game where
                  players use various methods of input to control and manipulate
                  moving images created by a computer program. This definition
                  is an intentionally open one: not all video games involve
                  killing enemies or chasing a high score. Some feel more like
                  pieces of art, or even entire galleries thereof. Take Asmik
                  Ace Entertainment’s <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em>, for example.
                  Directly inspired by one of the developer’s decades-spanning
                  dream journals, the game has players travel through and
                  explore incoherent, dream-like spaces.[8] After each level (if
                  they even be called that), the player is placed on a quadrant
                  chart with “downer” and “upper” as the x-axes and “static” and
                  “dynamic” as the y-axes. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Sato 1998</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Sato, Osamu, dir. 1998. <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em>.

                  <em>LSD</em> is a video game, yes, but it doesn’t really
                  behave like a game. The player is never scored; there are no
                  other characters you can interact with; there isn’t even much
                  gameplay besides walking around and observing the art. Much
                  like, say, an art gallery. Ignoring the fact that it exists
                  not as a physical structure, can
                  <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em> be considered a museum? The
                  player isn’t really taught anything, but the same could be
                  said about art museums whose labels include little more than
                  the artist, the medium, and the year painted. The deciding
                  factor, then, should be intent: are these video games or other
                  digital media projects intended to be treated like a museum?
                  For <em>LSD</em>, the answer seems to be no. It functions as
                  more an individual art piece, something to be displayed in and
                  of itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>LSD Dream Emulator</em> is by far not the only not-game
                  video game to take on the language of art and museums. In
                  November of 2021, British art-rock band Radiohead released
                  <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em>. The game is best described
                  as a visual arts museum dedicated to albums <em>Kid A</em> and
                  <em>Amnesiac</em>, each song given a room with surreal,
                  occasionally unsettling accompanying visuals. It may not exist
                  in the real world, but the intention for this to be an actual,
                  physical museum space was there from the start.

                  Thom Yorke, Radiohead’s frontman, and Stanley Donwood,
                  Radiohead’s main artist, both initially wanted Kid A Mnesia to
                  be an exhibit at the U.K.’s Victoria and Albert Museum.
                  Intending to create the space by welding together shipping
                  containers, the pair wanted it to look out of place in
                  Victoria and Albert’s classical architecture, forcing it into
                  London like an “ice pick into Trotsky.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Yorke 2021</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Yorke, Thom. 2021.

The exhibit couldn’t exist at
                  the V&amp;A without serious structural damages; the
                  Westminster council denied a change of location to the Royal
                  Albert Hall; finally, COVID-19 hit and fully denied any plans
                  of a physical exhibition space.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In many ways, <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> is more video game than
                  museum. It has a pause menu and lets you “run” with the shift
                  key; the exhibit even saves your progress if you close it and
                  then reopen at a later time. But the game has a deeply vested
                  interest in recreating the visual language of museums. Its
                  rooms contain visible fire extinguishers, camera, and digital
                  stick-figure maintenance staff; the walls guide players along
                  much like at a “real” museum. It even recreates a
                  near-universal museum experience: walking into a part of an
                  exhibit with a short film and needing to wait an awkward
                  amount of time for it to restart. Except, in this case, the
                  short film is distorted footage of Thom Yorke creating a song
                  with various synthesizers and the other museum patron in the
                  room is a white, paper-mache imp staring directly at you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em> is a museum, then it
                  should be able to be described by one of Marstine’s four
                  metaphors. It certainly isn’t a colonizing space, nor is it a
                  market-driven industry; the game, after all, is free. It does
                  match the criteria to be a shrine, however— a shrine, more
                  specifically, to the paired albums of <em>Kid A</em> and
                  <em>Amnesiac</em>. More traditional art museums have a similar
                  lack of explanation or education about their works, simply
                  displaying each piece with its title and author, much like
                  <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> has. Despite its video game-based
                  idiosyncrasies, <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> truly does seem to
                  function as a museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Video games also have the potential to serve as tools of
                  learning beyond just mimicking museums. After all, games are
                  already primed to teach— it is impossible to pick up a new
                  game without, in some manner, the game teaching its players
                  new mechanics. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Anderson 2019, 178</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Anderson, Sky LaRell. “The Interactive Museum: Video

                  its world. Take, for example, <em>Dark Souls III</em>, a
                  notoriously difficult action role-playing by studio From
                  Software. Beyond being difficult, the Dark Souls series is
                  known for having lore that players need to work to learn
                  about, spawning droves of YouTube accounts dedicated to
                  learning about the games’ worlds. The similarities to
                  real-world history are easily apparent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Much of the lore in <em>Dark Souls III</em> comes from the
                  descriptions of various in-game items. As these descriptions
                  are some of the only ways of learning the history of the
                  game’s world, dedicated players spend great amounts of time
                  delving into the descriptions. Valorheart, a combination sword
                  and shield, is no exception, as its description sheds light on
                  some minor aspects of the game’s world:

                  The champion fought on, without rest, until he lost his mind.

                  Much can be gleaned from just this short description. First,
                  whatever society this Champion belonged to used to value
                  gladiatorial combat between various undead people and was
                  structured enough to have pages— that is, knights’ assistants.
                  Additionally, it may have viewed the lion as an important
                  symbol, given its presence on Valorheart’s shield.

                  While it of course has its differences, this process is not
                  dissimilar to real life history. Players and historians both
                  have to make inferences about past societies using only what
                  these cultures left behind, whether it be real, written
                  accounts or fictional item descriptions.
                  <em>Dark Souls III</em> is by no means an educational title,
                  but it shows how games can be used to teach. This goes beyond
                  just self-identified educational games, as those “tend to be
                  boring, monotonous, and frankly not very well-designed
                  visually, mechanically, or even pedagogically.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Anderson 2019, 191</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Anderson, Sky LaRell. “The Interactive Museum: Video

                  for potentially hours, something which traditional methods of
                  education rarely are able to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Games cannot, of course, outright replace traditional methods
                  of education like classes or textbooks. Instead, they can
                  function as methods of “tangential learning,” in which the
                  education takes place in the background, almost unnoticed,
                  while the main focus for the player is the game itself.

                  tangential learning to teach players about their game’s lore
                  without taking them out of the play experience, a technique
                  which could easily be used for real-world education.

                  In their individual ways, <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em>,
                  <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em>, and
                  <em>Dark Souls III</em> each showcase the benefits— and
                  potential pitfalls— of video games as museums. <em>LSD</em> is
                  perhaps the least museum-esque of the three, but it serves as
                  an example of video games as art. Like some museums that lack
                  interpretative labels, the game leaves its players (or perhaps
                  viewers) to interpret the art for themselves, allowing them to
                  each make their own distinct interpretations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> most directly represents the visual
                  design and visual language of museums. Radiohead was very
                  interested in recreating the experience of going to a museum,
                  while making use of the unique properties of video games to
                  create an experience more abstract than would be possible with
                  a real, brick-and-mortar museum. It also has the benefit of
                  being much more accessible than physical museums; while it
                  does require that players have a powerful enough computer to
                  run the program and have a general knowledge of how to play
                  first-person video games, anyone regardless of physical
                  location is able to play the game. There are also fewer
                  (although not zero) barriers with those with physical
                  disabilities, as there are no possibilities of inaccessible
                  bathrooms or lack of wheelchair-friendly ramps, for example.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> does not teach its players
                  anything, at least not directly. Most art museums, at least
                  American ones, have some interpretation. Labels explain the
                  artist’s history or inspirations; text on the walls explains
                  the overarching theme of an exhibit; docents answer visitors’
                  questions. The closest <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> comes to this is
                  the very beginning of the game, where some text on a wall
                  begins with modified lyrics from the band’s song “Pulk/Pull
                  Revolving Doors” followed by this somewhat cryptic poem:
                </p>
                <figure id="fig-broude-03" class="q-figure q-figure--image">

                  <figcaption class="q-figure__caption" data-outputs-include="epub,pdf">
                    <span class="q-figure__caption-content">The game’s introduction and accompanying poem.</span>
                    <span class="q-figure__credit"></span>
                  </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  This begs the question: do museums need to be educational? Or
                  is the presentation of art in an interesting manner enough?
                  While Kid A Mnesia may at times look like a museum, calling
                  itself an exhibition and providing a museum-esque map at a
                  linked website, it often does not function like one. It
                  intentionally dehumanizes every other person in the space,
                  other “guests” and museum employees alike being rendered as
                  simple stick figures. Instead, the game uses the design space
                  of museums as background context to show the players its art
                  and its music, less interested in pedagogy and more interested
                  in evoking specific feelings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On top of all of that, Kid A Mnesia does not make use of video
                  games’ specific strengths as a medium; it uses its unreal
                  location to be able to create impossible geometry and layouts,
                  yes, but beyond that the experience is akin to that of going
                  to a physical museum. While that was probably intentional,
                  given the project’s initial roots as a real exhibit, video
                  games are capable of providing learning experiences in manners
                  wildly different from actual museums.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike <em>LSD Dream Emulator</em>, which functions more like
                  a piece of art than a game, and <em>Kid A Mnesia</em>, with
                  its interest in the visual language of museums,
                  <em>Dark Souls III</em> does not in any way try to mimic or
                  recreate real-world art or museums. Despite this, it still
                  manages to teach its players about its fictional setting in a
                  manner potentially more effective and engaging than
                  traditional classroom environments. What if, then, instead of
                  video games mimicking museums, museums mimicked video games?
                  In further exploration of this question, Seb Chan discusses
                  <em>Sleep No More</em>, an immersive theater experience
                  “loosely based on Macbeth [and] inspired by film noir.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Chan 2012</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Chan, Seb. 2012. “On Sleep No More, Magic and Immersive

                      23, 2012.</span></cite>) In the video game-esque production, mask-clad guests freely
                  wander the stage, gaining a highly unique and individualized
                  experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Museums have always been wary of overly theatrical
                  experiences, lest they be labeled as “charlatans.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Chan 2012</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Chan, Seb. 2012. “On Sleep No More, Magic and Immersive

                      23, 2012.</span></cite>) But that attitude betrays museums’ nineteenth century
                  popular roots— roots of cabinets of curiosities and freak
                  shows (despite the unsavory nature of the name) advertising
                  wonders like “‘miracles of modern medicine…’ [and] freak
                  shows.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Chan 2012</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Chan, Seb. 2012. “On Sleep No More, Magic and Immersive

                      23, 2012.</span></cite>) Museums could have a lot to gain from interactive
                  experiences like Sleep No More or video games writ large.<br>
                  To break the veil of academic professionalism, some of my
                  recent favorite museum experiences have come from heavily
                  interactive exhibits. Planet Word, a linguistics-focused
                  museum in Washington, D.C., has several very interactive
                  experiences. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Planet Word</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">‘Planet Word.’ Planet Word Museum. Accessed November
                      23rd, 2023.
                      <a href="#page-https-planetwordmuseum-org" target="_blank">https://planetwordmuseum.org/</a></span></cite>) These range from a collaborative lesson with a computer
                  about English etymology to helping an artificial intelligence
                  workshop its jokes. While not on the same level of
                  interactivity as <em>Sleep No More</em>, Planet Word’s
                  exhibits show how much more engaging non-linear, personalized
                  experiences can be. As a college linguistics major, I hardly
                  learned anything at Planet Word, but I nevertheless found it
                  all incredibly fun. Working with a group of fellow guests
                  trying to guess the language of origin of “shampoo” (Hindi)
                  was a more memorable experience than simply reading some text
                  on a wall discussing the origins of the word.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the world continues to further digitize, museums need to
                  digitize with it. Although I will always love museums, ranging
                  from the imposing federally funded affairs to the hyper-local,
                  low budget exhibits, they can be intimidating and difficult to
                  break into. I am not suggesting that museum docents should
                  lead guests to a video game console and have that be the
                  majority of the visit, but the inherent accessibility and
                  individuality of game-like experiences should be considered.
                  This could even be a step towards Marstine’s idealized “post
                  museum,” a community-focused endeavor that aims not to simply
                  collect and study but to engage with its visitors and local
                  community on a more personal level.

                  is a virtual museum dedicated to preserving, documenting, and
                  sharing the history of girlhood and female empowerment. Unlike
                  other museums, Girl Museum doesn’t have a physical building
                  that people can visit. Instead, the museum has a website with
                  virtual exhibitions that people can interact and engage with
                  online. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Impact 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Impact”. <em>Girl Museum</em>

                  their exhibtions, and the future of Girl Museum. To provide
                  more in-depth information on Girl Museum and how the staff
                  curate their virtual exhibitions, I have included summaries
                  and video clips from two interviews that I conducted with the
                  Founder and Head Girl Ashley E. Remer and the Education
                  Advisor Hillary Rose at Girl Museum.

                <h2>What is Girl Museum?</h2>
                <p>
                  Girl Museum is a virtual arts and social history museum that
                  is run entirely by volunteers. Unlike a traditional museum,
                  Girl Museum has no stanchions or offices, no personal
                  collection, and no paid staff. The museum was founded by Head
                  Girl Ashley E. Remer, a current PhD student at Australian
                  National University in Art History. The museum is also
                  overseen by a Board of Directors, an Advisory board of
                  scholars, and a senior staff of long-term volunteers dedicated
                  to specific programs and projects including Education Advisor
                  Hillary Rose. The museum also has a team of Junior Girls,
                  which includes interns and younger volunteers. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Impact 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Impact”. <em>Girl Museum</em>
                      <a href="#page-https-www-girlmuseum-org-about-impact" target="_blank">https://www.girlmuseum.org/about/impact/</a></span></cite>) A year into the museum’s creation, Remer quickly realized
                  that she needed to hire interns to help with the overwhelming
                  amount of work that she had to create the museum. The
                  overwhelming number of responses from women in a variety of
                  fields across the world exceeded Remer’s expectations. In
                  2010, Remer assembled a team of seven interns from around the
                  world, which became the first cohort of Junior Girls. The
                  interns helped create exhibitions, write for the blog, apply
                  for grants, and explore other resources and projects for the
                  museum. Many of those interns became long term volunteers and
                  are still on the staff today. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Remer 2010</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ashley Remer, “Girl Museum: a Global Project, Girlhood

                      140-148.</span></cite>) This is a testament to the incredible dedication and
                  passion that is coming out of Girl Museum.

                <h2>The Girl Museum</h2>
                <p>
                  The Girl Museum has
                  <a href="#page-https-www-girlmuseum-org-view-exhibitions" target="_blank">39 virtual exhibits</a>, a podcast called
                  <a href="#page-https-www-girlmuseum-org-view-projects" target="_blank">GirlSpeak</a>, a blog, and many other resources for its visitors. The
                  GirlSpeak podcast is currently on hold, but past episodes can
                  be found on their website as well as Spotify and Apple
                  Podcasts. Girl Museum also has an Instagram, Facebook, YouTube
                  channel, and a Twitter page where they are able to market
                  their virtual exhibits, podcast episodes, and share additional
                  content on the history of girls and girlhood. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Impact 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Impact”. <em>Girl Museum</em>
                      <a href="#page-https-www-girlmuseum-org-about-impact" target="_blank">https://www.girlmuseum.org/about/impact/</a></span></cite>) In the past the museum had also created a few online
                  exhibits on Tumblr, but they are no longer on the site. The
                  main focus of Girl Museum are their virtual exhibits that are
                  broken into four sections, Girlhood in Art, Art of Girlhood,
                  Girls in the World, and Contemporary Art. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Exhibitions 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Exhibitions.” <em>Girl Museum</em>, July 3, 2022.
                      <a href="#page-https-www-girlmuseum-org-view-exhibitions" target="_blank">https://www.girlmuseum.org/view/exhibitions/.</a>"</span></cite>) Unlike museums that highlight the digitized objects from
                  their personal collection or others within the same
                  institution (ie. Smithsonian museums sharing objects with each
                  other), Girl Museum uses copyright-free and open access
                  digitized objects from other museum collections in their
                  virtual exhibits. In displaying the objects in their exhibits,
                  Girl Museum highlights art, history and cultural institutions
                  from around the world. One challenge in this model, however,
                  is that some museums have begun to copyright their digitized
                  objects, forcing the museum to pay to use them. Girl Museum
                  has limited funds and cannot always afford to pay for those
                  copyrights. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Remer 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Remer, Ashley. Recorded interview via Zoom with author,

                <h2>What are Virtual Exhibitions?</h2>
                <p>
                  Virtual exhibits, also referred to as digital exhibits, are an
                  ensemble of interlinks curated in a section of a museum’s
                  website that has the objective to disseminate digital
                  multimedia content to deliver innovative presentations of a
                  concept or movement. Virtual exhibits are similar to physical
                  exhibits in that curators have to think constructively about
                  the theme or concept that will help to tie the objects
                  together. The main objective of exhibitions is to provide a
                  space for the presentation of artifacts, art pieces, and other
                  objects that serve as a center of knowledge specialized in a
                  thematic area.

                  Implementing a virtual exhibit doesn’t simply mean publishing
                  images of cultural objects in a gallery, it involves creating
                  an interesting software product that supports the visitor’s
                  experience. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ciurea and Filip 2019</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ciurea, Cristian, and Florin Gheorghe Filip. “Virtual

                  feel as if a museum was virtually stepping into a museum. The
                  homepage had white stone columns on either side similar to
                  those founded on the front of many museum buildings around the
                  world. Each virtual exhibit had a separate background color
                  and font that would make it feel as if visitors were entering
                  different rooms of a museum. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Remer 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Remer, Ashley. Recorded interview via Zoom with author,
                      October 20, 2023.</span></cite>) Early scholars in the field argued that the 2D interface
                  leaves little to no room for an immersive experience, whereas
                  a 3D virtual recreation of a physical exhibition or museum
                  allows visitors to navigate the virtual scenario in a way that
                  is closer to the reality of walking through the physical
                  building. Unfortunately, the software tools associated with
                  creating the 3D model of virtual exhibitions are not always
                  accessible to museum staff as they require sophisticated and
                  expensive equipment. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ciurea and Filip 2019</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ciurea, Cristian, and Florin Gheorghe Filip. “Virtual

                  create a virtual museum that resembled a physical museum,
                  Remer states that she found the initial website for the museum
                  to be too busy and overwhelming for visitors. Over the years,
                  she has found that their current style, though simple, is the
                  most accessible, sustainable, and effective way to entice and
                  engage visitors in the museum’s many virtual exhibits.

                <h2>How Girl Museum Curates Their Virtual Exhibits</h2>
                <p>
                  Curating a virtual exhibit at Girl Museum begins with a
                  meeting between Remer, Rose, and the curators where they
                  discuss what the exhibit is going to be about, what will be
                  featured at the exhibit, and how long the exhibit will take to
                  create from start to finish. According to both Remer and Rose,
                  exhibits normally take anywhere from 1-3 years to complete,
                  but the museum’s staff can be flexible with that timeline to
                  take advantage of opportunities that come up quickly. After
                  the initial meeting, a Google doc is created where those who
                  are working on the exhibit are able to put digitized photos of
                  the objects that will be featured in the exhibit, research
                  done on the topic of the exhibit, and other important
                  information relevant to the exhibit. This Google doc allows
                  the volunteers to gather information for the exhibit on their
                  own schedule without having to deal with multiple meetings,
                  especially since the volunteers are located around the world.
                  The team of volunteers that are working on the exhibit, along
                  with Remer, will then begin to draw an outline as to what the
                  exhibit is going to look like on the website. The information
                  is then brought to the Program Manager Tiffany R. Isselhardt
                  who inputs the exhibitions onto the website, which is located
                  on Wordpress. The team then checks the exhibit for any
                  spelling and grammar mistakes before it is posted to the
                  public. Right before the exhibit goes live, Rose and a few
                  other volunteers will then begin to create an Educational
                  Guide PDF for the exhibit that teachers and parents can use
                  with young children to help them further engage with the
                  information and topics explored in the exhibit. Rose and Remer
                  are always seeking to find new ways to use the online space to
                  the fullest to provide many resources for girls around the
                  world. For instance, many of the Girl Speak podcast episodes
                  are attached to the virtual exhibits along with videos and
                  other sources of media that help to make the exhibits more
                  engaging and interactive to visitors.

                  is a virtual exhibit that provides an overview to the history
                  of girls and girlhood. This exhibit is Remer’s personal
                  favorite and one that she advises many first-time visitors
                  take a look at to gain a better understanding as to the type
                  of work that the museum is hopping to do with their other
                  virtual exhibits. The exhibit is broken down into four
                  sections Girlhood in Art, Art of Girlhood, Girls in the World,
                  and then lastly GirlSpeak. The exhibit tackles a variety of
                  issues concerning young girls throughout the world and
                  highlights important young girls in history including Anne
                  Frank. There is an education guide at the bottom of the
                  exhibit that encourages visitors to answer questions about the
                  exhibit, analysis the images that are found throughout the
                  exhibit and activities that young girls can do to help them
                  further engage with the information provided in the exhibit.

                  instead provides visitors with a lot of in-depth information
                  on a variety of topics. The long forum of in-depth information
                  present in <em>Defining Our Terms</em> is not something that
                  can always occur in physical museums, due to a lack of space.

                  The virtual exhibit
                  <a href="#page-https-www-girlmuseum-org-project-52-objects" target="_blank"><em>52 Objects in the History of Girls</em></a>
                  is one of Rose’s favorite exhibits that she has taken part in
                  creating at the museum as it explores fifty-two objects that
                  represent girls and girlhood from many different cultures
                  located around the world. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Rose 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Rose, Hillary. Recorded interview via Zoom with author,

                  each week. The exhibit has an interactive map from Google maps
                  that pins each object in the exhibition to its country of
                  origin. Each object is also featured on the main page of the
                  exhibit with a short description that visitors can click on to
                  be sent to a blog post that provides more in-depth information
                  on the object and its culture of origin. The blog posts were
                  written by the volunteers at the museum.

                  interactive element to the exhibit and the blog posts allow
                  for more long forum descriptions that provide in-depth
                  information on the cultures and the objects. The blog posts in
                  the <em>52 Objects in the History of Girls</em> exhibit
                  provides visitors with more information than they would
                  normally receive from a physical exhibition. This results in
                  an exhibition that enhances the visitor experience for those
                  who may enjoy seeing the objects in a physical exhibition but
                  am wanting to learn more about them.

                  Other ways that Girl Museum uses the online space more fully
                  in their other virtual exhibitions is by providing links to
                  organizations that greatly impact girls around the world,
                  youtube videos and other sources of multimedia content that
                  help to provide more context and infromation to the topic of
                  the exhibit, and posting comments made by young girls and
                  women around the world on what a girl means to them. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Exhibitions 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Exhibitions.” <em>Girl Museum</em>, July 3, 2022.

                  exhibition that takes full advantage of the limitless space
                  that the internet has to offer for museums. Despite not
                  feeling as if visitors are clicking through virtual reality
                  versions of physical exhibits. Girl Museum has continued to
                  find ways to make their 2D interface as interactive and
                  engaging as possible to visitors. This has resulted in Girl
                  Museum creating virtual exhibitions that many other museums
                  could use as a blueprint when curating their virtual/digital
                  exhibitions.

                <p>
                  Accessibility to another essential characteristic of virtual
                  exhibits. This became essential during the Covid-19 pandemic
                  when many museums closed their doors to the public after
                  people were told to stay at home and socially distance in
                  order to help slow down the virus. Virtual museums allow for
                  visitors from the local community and around the world to
                  visit and interact with objects without the limitations of
                  time or location. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it became
                  increasingly clear to museums that they should have
                  digital/virtual exhibits that go along with their physical
                  exhibits.

                  Another challenge for Girl Museum is that it is illegal for
                  anyone to track the data of children under eighteen years old.
                  Unfortunately, Girl Museum’s target audience is children
                  between twelve- and eighteen-year-old girls. The museum has
                  begun to roll out a survey to teachers that would hopefully
                  help to gage how teachers have found the museum’s exhibitions
                  helpful in the classroom. With the help of Google analytics,
                  the Museum is able to track their visitors who are above the
                  age of eighteen years old. According to their 2022 Yearly
                  Report, Girl Museum brought in about 172,210 visitors, their
                  high-test attendance yet, with 187 new community members and
                  produced 3 new exhibitions. About 60 percent of the visitors
                  identified as female, with about 32% being between ages 18-24,
                  with most of their visitors coming from the United States,
                  United Kingdom, and India. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Impact 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Impact”. <em>Girl Museum</em>

                  target audience, this data still highlights that the virtual
                  exhibitions are receiving positive feedback from visitors.
                </p>
                <h2>Looking into the Future:</h2>
                <p>
                  Despite their decision to produce exhibitions that use the 2D
                  presentation model, the staff at Girl Museum, have been
                  interested in curating an exhibit that would be a 3D virtual
                  reality simulation of a physical exhibit. The exhibit would
                  have walls and digitized replications of art pieces and other
                  objects that visitors could virtually walk through using a VR
                  headset or click through with their mouse. The museum was in
                  contact with a few people at a major software company to make
                  a prototype of a virtual reality exhibit that Girl Museum
                  would later be able to put on their website. After a few
                  emails, the staff at the major software company decided to not
                  purse the project further. Due to a lack of funding, they
                  aren’t able to curate a 3D virtual reality simulation of a
                  physical exhibit on their own to post to the website without
                  having a team of volunteers that would be able to produce the
                  project. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Remer 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Remer, Ashley. Recorded interview via Zoom with author,

                  anything by not producing 3D virtual reality exhibitions.
                  However, Remer and the rest of the staff at Girl Museum are
                  always looking for ways to expand their resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Girl Museum has recently released an exhibit titled
                  <em>Sitting Still</em> that include 45 paintings, miniatures,
                  prints, and watercolors from public and private collections
                  around the world that are from the 15th century through to the
                  mid 20th century of girls sitting. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Exhibitions 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Exhibitions.” <em>Girl Museum</em>, July 3, 2022.
                      <a href="#page-https-www-girlmuseum-org-view-exhibitions" target="_blank">https://www.girlmuseum.org/view/exhibitions/.</a>"</span></cite>) The two other exhibits in this series are currently in
                  production mode and will be released in 2024 and 2025.
                  Currently, the staff at Girl Museum are also reflecting on all
                  their exhibits, the podcast, the blog, and the other resources
                  that are on the website to see how they can better serve their
                  visitors. In the future, Remer and the staff would like to
                  produce documentaries, short films, classes, an online
                  database on girlhood, and many other resources aside from the
                  virtual exhibits. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Remer 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Remer, Ashley. Recorded interview via Zoom with author,

Recorded interview via Zoom with author,
                      October 20, 2023.</span></cite>) Even though the virtual exhibits are a big focus of the
                  museum, the staff are constantly coming up with new projects
                  that better serve girls around the world. Once the staff
                  curates a list of projects that they would like to create, the
                  staff will then begin to contact institutions and
                  organizations that the museum could potentially partner with
                  on these projects, along with writing grants that would help
                  them receive some additional funding to put into these
                  projects. In the future, Remer would also like to be able to
                  get a technology volunteer that would be willing to work on
                  figuring out more ways that the museum could help to make some
                  of these projects happen. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Remer 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Remer, Ashley. Recorded interview via Zoom with author,

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  Girl Museum highlights the need for museums to focus more
                  attention on how they can better serve visitors online. When
                  it comes to producing digital/virtual exhibitions, museums
                  should explore how they could feature objects that are within
                  their collection, along with various sources of multi-media
                  content found online, to enhance the visitor experience. Even
                  though the staff at the museum has focused most of its
                  attention on curating informative and education virtual
                  exhibitions, the future of Girl Museum highlights the
                  limitless possibilities that museums have to curate helpful
                  resources for anyone located around the world to use. This
                  highlights the importance of online institutions like Girl
                  Museum as they are able to make information more accessible to
                  anyone around the world who may not be able to visit museums
                  physically in person. As a museum entirely volunteered based,
                  this also showcases how essential this passionate and
                  committed staff is to producing resources for girls around the
                  world.

                  Digitization processes have become standard practice for large
                  museums and cultural institutions. These processes can create
                  a variety of products that can be shared with broader
                  audiences and researchers. Museums can deliver things like
                  high-quality photos, complex 3D scans of objects, immersive
                  digital experiences, and endless applications for researchers.
                  These projects are often incredibly expensive, require costly
                  equipment and specialized knowledge, and take a tremendous
                  amount of time to produce. With the barrier of entry so high,
                  many smaller cultural institutions have no way of funding
                  these projects, instead relying on unpredictable grant
                  funding. Here I will be exploring potential low-cost
                  alternatives to the traditional costly digitization project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the past, I have worked on a museum digitization project
                  working primarily with natural history collections. Our work
                  was high-resolution static photography with the objects inside
                  of a lightbox. Working with that project inspired me to feel
                  passionate about collections digitization, something that
                  continues to fascinate me today. Our incredibly inexpensive
                  setup was still only able to be realized because we were
                  fortunate enough to have the project financed through a state
                  grant. With the high barrier of entry to digitization projects
                  of even a decent quality, I found myself constantly thinking
                  of inexpensive ways to allow small museums to produce digital
                  representations of their collection objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Recently lines of consumer technology like cellphones and
                  tablets have come standard with LiDAR functions built into the
                  camera sensors. This allows something like a cellphone to
                  measure the distance from the camera to an object. This means
                  that there are various applications that can use these LiDAR
                  scans to create 3D renderings of complex objects. These scans
                  are of course not as high quality as ones produced by
                  dedicated LiDAR scanners, but the barrier for entry is far
                  lower. The potential for museum employees to use inexpensive
                  hardware (that some employees might already have) to produce
                  even decent-quality 3D renderings can open many doors for
                  smaller institutions. However, LiDAR is not the only avenue
                  for producing renderings of objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The other type of digitization commonly seen in museums is 3D
                  Photogrammetry. Photogrammetry is a process that uses multiple
                  2D photos of an object from numerous angles to stitch together
                  a complex 3D model of the object in question. Photogrammetry
                  is a more time-consuming process requiring post-processing and
                  using often complicated and proprietary software. Other
                  open-source alternatives are available but are typically built
                  on Blender, a program frequently used for 3D modeling, which
                  can have a steep learning curve. Photogrammetry setups
                  typically require one or many DSLR cameras to capture many
                  photos from different angles, and a rotating surface that
                  allows an object being digitized to not require constant
                  adjustment. The barriers to entry for this method are again
                  primarily monetary. These scanning setups can be expensive to
                  produce and time-consuming to produce scans with. The programs
                  typically required to produce these models are also
                  complicated and can require specialized knowledge. However, a
                  potential solution again may reside in the consumer tech we
                  all walk around with.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With recent technology allowing easier scans to be produced,
                  and with cellphone cameras taking higher resolution photos
                  than ever before, the opportunities for democratized 3D
                  modeling are starting to be realized. In exploring the ways
                  financially constrained museums can produce reasonable quality
                  3D scans I found numerous services and applications that offer
                  cloud computing for 3D modeling using scans from cellphones
                  and tablets. These applications require you to upload your
                  photos or scans to their servers, where their automated
                  processes will complete the modeling for the user and return a
                  finalized 3D scan. These applications frequently offer a free
                  limited license and an inexpensive unrestricted license. Of
                  course, there is a catch, the question of ownership of the
                  models produced is important for cultural institutions seeking
                  to use these tools, and each application has different rules
                  in their terms of service. The application I chose to use for
                  this exploration, Polycam, grants the user ownership of the
                  models produced but retains the rights to use said scans for a
                  wide variety of applications on their end (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Terms of Service, 8-9</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Terms of Service.” poly.cam, May 1, 2023.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Producing 3D scans has clearly become easier and cheaper than
                  ever before. This means that previously cost-prohibitive
                  scanning projects may be approachable for even financially
                  constrained institutions. In terms of hardware, employees may
                  already own a cellphone or tablet capable of performing LiDAR
                  scans, and any relatively recent smartphone can take photos
                  that will work for cloud-processed scans. These processes are
                  intuitive and quick, meaning that there’s no need for
                  specialized training or hiring staff with technical knowledge,
                  this can be completed by almost any employee with a short
                  training window.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To illustrate the workflow, deliverables, and relative ease of
                  these scanning processes I have created 3D models of an
                  antique camera I had sitting on my desk. I chose this object
                  because it is small and easy to handle but is still complex
                  with lots of room for detail. It will also serve to highlight
                  the differences between LiDAR and photogrammetry-derived
                  models. These scans were produced using Polycam, but the
                  workflow is largely the same between any of the cloud
                  processing scanning applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For producing the LiDAR-derived model, the camera was placed
                  on a surface to elevate it from the countertop I was scanning
                  it on. The app shows a wireframe projection when scanning in
                  LiDAR capture mode, giving you an idea of what the scan will
                  produce. This does not totally convey the final product, but
                  it illustrates the concept of the scan itself. The application
                  then requires you to physically move around the object. The
                  camera measures the time it takes for light to reach the
                  subject and then bounces back and uses this to estimate the
                  distance of various points. The app then produces a raw LiDAR
                  measurement of the object and the space around it. In the
                  image, you will see several triangles floating in space in a
                  circle. Each triangle represents an area in which a
                  measurement was made. This is the final step that the user
                  needs to complete before the data is sent to the application
                  servers for processing. This raw LiDAR scan is uploaded and
                  after a short wait (about 10 minutes in my experience) the
                  finalized model is produced.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  The scans produced using LiDAR are certainly quick to create
                  and the easier of the two methods. The models produced are not
                  necessarily of the best quality. The hard edges are rounded,
                  there are inaccurate protrusions, and the texture looks like
                  it was wrapped over the object mesh, creating a flatter image.
                  There are upsides to this technique though. These models are
                  naturally made to scale. There’s no need for post-processing
                  to change the scale. This means that when using object viewing
                  programs you can take measurements of the object good enough
                  for reference in the case of object housing, display
                  fabrication, or shipping container design. Producing these
                  models could be useful for internal reference so objects do
                  not require frequent handling. These scans may be more
                  appropriate for larger and less complicated objects that would
                  be difficult to capture with photogrammetry. Large
                  archaeological objects, sculptures, furniture, and vehicles
                  are just some examples of objects this scan may be more
                  appropriate for.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  Creating models from a photogrammetry process was more
                  time-consuming but ultimately produced a better result. The
                  process started the same way as the LiDAR scan. The camera was
                  placed on a surface to elevate it. Instead of walking around
                  the camera and having my device automatically record the
                  scans, I walked around the camera and manually took photos
                  from the various angles in total I took 123 photos. These
                  photos were taken from the lowest possible angle to get images
                  underneath the overhangs. Many photos were also taken from a
                  high angle to get several isometric perspectives of the
                  entirety of the object. The photos were uploaded and began
                  processing. For the photogrammetry process, the scans took
                  longer to process, usually around 20-30 minutes. The final
                  output was of a higher quality than the LiDAR scans. The
                  surface texture was more accurately applied, edges and forms
                  appear more accurate, and the areas of distress and damage on
                  the object are more visible. This is a far more accurate
                  process for a small and complex object like a camera.

                <p>
                  Comparing these two processes illustrates a key discovery of
                  this exploration. These processes are effective at
                  accomplishing different objectives, and one is not inherently
                  better than the other. LiDAR scans are quick but do not
                  produce an incredible amount of detail on small complicated
                  objects. Using these scans for large objects that would be
                  difficult to produce with photogrammetry scanning can allow
                  even the largest objects to be digitized. These scans can be
                  used for smaller complex objects of course, but they may not
                  be of a quality that the organization would want to release
                  publicly. The fact that these models are produced already to
                  scale means there’s potential for internal applications as
                  well. Photogrammetry scanning is more time-consuming but
                  ultimately does create much better scans. These scans may be
                  more appropriate for public release.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  The final important consideration for these processes is the
                  ultimate quality of the scans themselves. Institutions
                  exploring budget digitization objects should not expect scans
                  that rival the detailed professional scans produced by large
                  museums. The technology in our pockets cannot rival dedicated
                  scanners and complex software that create these high-fidelity
                  models. Organizations exploring these budget solutions should
                  have discussions about the quality of scans they wish to
                  achieve and what they would consider to be good enough quality
                  for public release. Even if these processes are not employed
                  by museums at this time, it is clearly worth following the
                  innovations in this field. Five years ago, cloud computing
                  photogrammetry scans derived from cellphone photos was
                  something I would have never expected. As consumer technology
                  continues to see innovation, we can expect to see further
                  democratization of 3D scanning technology.

                <p>
                  Remembering history has been important to humans since the
                  beginning. Pictures were drawn, stories passed down through
                  generations, information written down and stored; all have
                  helped to keep the past accessible in the present, to remember
                  who we are and where we came from. Oral history has been
                  collected for thousands of years. One early account is found
                  in the histories of the Zhou dynasty in China where oral
                  histories had been written down in the courts. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ritchie 2003, 19</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ritchie, Donald A.

                  as unscientific and biased” which was the opposite of the
                  desires of the time for researchers of all disciplines to be
                  “as scientific and objective as possible” in their work.

                  through paper archives became a topic of interest for oral
                  history interviewing and recording, despite this opposition.
                  In the 1890s, Native Americans, who had kept most, though not
                  all, of their history through oral tradition were recorded by
                  the U.S. Bureau of Ethnography.

                  the Great Depression in the United States, the WPA, Works
                  Progress Administration, paid out of work writers to interview
                  and collect information on the lives of ordinary citizens.

                  groups since. Post World War II, thousands of oral history
                  interviews were conducted of those who fought in the war and
                  those who survived the horrors of the Holocaust.

                  Museums also began to take notice of the important role oral
                  history can play in an exhibit. They bring about a unique
                  perspective to the objects and exhibits being displayed. Some
                  museums create incredible oral history inclusions, such as the
                  Anacostia Community Museum’s most recent exhibition, To Live
                  and Breathe: Women and Environmental Justice in Washington,
                  D.C. Others still have a way to go. This essay will argue that
                  the utilization of oral history in museum exhibitions provides
                  a better human connection to the material being exhibited. It
                  will also contend that the practice of oral history is an
                  important way to remember shared histories and personal
                  stories. It should be collected often, on a wide array of
                  topics to remember the realities of human experiences.

                  Understanding what oral history is and how it is gathered is
                  important to the idea of using oral history in a museum
                  exhibit. It is important to note that oral tradition and oral
                  history are two different things, though often conflated with
                  one another. Oral tradition is a practice of passing down
                  history through word of mouth. Anyone can be a participant in
                  this. If a grandmother tells the story of how she met her
                  husband to her children and then they tell their children, and
                  then that story continues to get told to each new generation,
                  the story is kept alive through oral tradition within that
                  family. Oral history is different, and though it is often not
                  stated, this refers to interviews done with another person.
                  The interview aspect is an important part of what oral history
                  is today. A person recounts their life and experiences to
                  someone who is going to record and collect this information
                  for a multitude of uses. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ritchie 2003, 19</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ritchie, Donald A. Doing Oral History: A practical guide.
                      Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003.</span></cite>) Knowing how this information is collected and gathered will
                  lead to a better understanding of what benefit it would bring
                  to a museum exhibit.

                <h2>Collecting Oral History</h2>
                <p>
                  Though there are no strict requirements on how to collect oral
                  history, the Oral History Association, OHA, gives guidelines
                  on best practices. There is an outline of how to prepare to
                  for interviews, what to do while interviewing, and how to
                  collect and preserve the oral histories one conducts. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Oral History Association 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">OHA. “OHA Principles and Best Practices.” October 2018.

                </p>
                <p>
                  What makes a good oral history interview? It starts with the
                  preparation. Preparing for the interview with solid questions
                  helps to keep the interviews consistent, making sure the
                  interviewees all have an opportunity to answer each important
                  question. The OHA recommends interviewing the subject in a
                  quiet space and gathering a diverse and relevant group of
                  people to interview. They encourage open-ended discussions and
                  questions that guide the interviewee to provide more context
                  and information, rather than answer just the question asked.
                  The OHA also recommends getting a legal release signed at the
                  time of the interview, preferably at the end. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Oral History Association 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">OHA. “OHA Principles and Best Practices.” October 2018.

                  collection of oral history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My own experiences in collecting oral history do not match up
                  exactly – and I think that is okay. Oral history guidelines
                  help create a uniformed collection. However, that does not
                  mean oral history cannot still be accomplished. As an
                  undergrad student, I did a research project for a class where
                  I found there was a huge gap in information. I had decided to
                  do research on housewives in US history from the 1950s into
                  the present day. I wanted to compare the differences in how
                  their role had changed in the home over time and how society’s
                  perception of them had changed over time. Unfortunately, the
                  kind of information I needed regarding more modern-day
                  examples didn’t really exist. No one had really done any sort
                  of research in this missing area and it was in this moment
                  that I decided to create the information myself. I set out to
                  interview some women in my community to be able to finish my
                  project. I created a specified set of questions to ask them
                  all that I felt would give me an accurate understanding. This
                  early stage of creating oral history was purely for a small
                  subset of my own personal use in a college assignment. I had
                  no formal training, it was right after a pandemic, and I was
                  just hoping to get information I could use in my project. I
                  learned along the way how to better ask the questions to get
                  those I interviewed to tell a story rather than just answer
                  the question and be done. I conducted the interviews wherever
                  the women would meet up with me, so unfortunately, some of
                  them are in a more crowded coffee shop, not exactly the quiet
                  space the OHA recommends. It was not until the semester ended
                  and I turned in my project when I realized that deleting the
                  twenty or so interviews I had spent so much time doing did not
                  feel right. With some guidance by a professor, I decide to
                  reach out to the library on campus to see if they would be
                  interested in housing them as a collection. Researchers could
                  use the information I had gathered in their projects and
                  papers. I reached out to the women I had previously spoken to
                  in order to get a signature allowing me to donate their
                  specific interview to the library and allow others to access
                  them.

                  My experience in collecting oral history wasn’t perfect, there
                  is minimal uniformity. I learned a lot along the way rather
                  than getting information up front. My intended use originally
                  was not for anyone but myself, so I didn’t follow the exact
                  OHA guidelines. Even still, I believe these interviews could
                  be of use to someone in the future, or educational, or
                  interesting and felt that they would be better served to the
                  public than just sitting on my computer forever. That is one
                  of the wonderful things about oral history interviews, even an
                  interview done for class can have a life larger than the
                  assignment it was originally intended for.

                <h2>What Makes Oral History so Special?</h2>
                <p>
                  What is so fascinating about oral history, is that anyone who
                  listens is able to hear about an experience from the mouth of
                  someone who lived it. Listeners can know exactly the tone of
                  voice that was used to tell the story, they can hear the
                  inflection on certain words and how they might change the
                  meaning. If the interview is video recorded, a viewer can
                  witness the emotion in the eyes of the speaker. They can see a
                  person has aged if they are telling stories from a time
                  before. Almost in a way, verifying that this person truly
                  lived in the past. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">de Jong 2018, 115</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">de Jong, Steffi. “Exhibiting: The Witness to History as a

                  Museums as institutions set out to tell stories, to bring
                  history into the present and inform those that step inside.
                  Using oral history to tell the stories, direct from the mouths
                  of those who experienced them, seems like an incredible way to
                  utilize a collection of history. Collecting oral history
                  allows stories that might never be told to get added to the
                  history books. People who could not read or write, who did not
                  have access to higher education were able to bring their
                  stories to the world through oral history interviews. Oral
                  history interviewing has been a tool that allows minorities of
                  all kinds, all over the world, to tell their stories when they
                  might not have been recorded otherwise. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ritchie 2003, 13,23</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ritchie, Donald A.

                  silenced by an ‘official’ narrative can refute and tell the
                  truth, like those living in the Soviet Union after its
                  collapse. Oral historians from Russia and Eastern Europe
                  became incredibly interested in interviewing regular people.
                  They reviewed and compared the ‘official’ narratives given by
                  the totalitarian regime and those given by the people who
                  lived in the former Soviet Union. When comparing the two, it
                  was easy to find holes and lies in the ‘official’ narrative
                  when so many regular people were giving a story that differed
                  from the government but matched other citizens.

                <h2>If it is so Special, What is the Problem?</h2>
                <p>
                  If oral history interviews are unique, bring human connection,
                  and help to tell a compelling story —what’s the problem? The
                  issue that lies within using oral history inside museums is
                  not so much an issue of access or a lack of material, but more
                  so it can be an issue with the space itself. How does a
                  curator or an exhibit designer put oral history into the
                  exhibit and make it a good addition? Sarah Zenaida Gould, a
                  curator from Texas, discusses some of her challenges in adding
                  oral history into her exhibitions. Managing the sound from
                  videos is one of the big ones. Trying not to overwhelm
                  visitors with too much sound stimulation is something curators
                  need to be cognizant of when putting together an exhibit. For
                  Gould, a solution was to use a ‘sound wand’ that visitors
                  could pick up to listen to the oral history. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Gould 2016</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Gould, Sarah Zenaida. “Challenges in exhibiting Oral

                  visitors did not stop to listen and she does not quite know
                  the reason. Too long? Missed it completely? Any number of
                  reasons could have kept visitors from engaging with the oral
                  interviews. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Gould 2016</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Gould, Sarah Zenaida. “Challenges in exhibiting Oral

                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the biggest issues that comes with displaying and
                  elevating oral history in a museum exhibit is there is no one
                  right way to do it. There is no formulaic way to display them,
                  to deal with the sound, to make them eye-catching enough to
                  grab the attention of a visitor, but not so long they walk
                  away before it is over. However, even without a formula to
                  display oral history, there are good processes utilized by
                  exhibit designers when it comes to sound in museums.
                  Understanding sound, even at a basic level, can help designers
                  and curators create a more cohesive space that does not
                  overwhelm the visitor. Types of sound can be placed into two
                  basic categories: diegetic and non-diegetic. Diegetic sound is
                  normally things like “audiovisual presentations, interactive
                  stations, and other content-driven musical/soundscape
                  installations,” or, things put in the foreground of an
                  exhibit. While non-diegetic sound is most often things that
                  appear naturally in the background; the scuffing of shoes,
                  kids laughing, background music can also be considered
                  non-diegetic. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Everett 2019, 314</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Everett, Tom. “A Curatorial Guide to Museum Sound
                      Design.” Curator (New York, N.Y.) 62.3 (2019): 313-32.
                      Web.</span></cite>) For a designer, understanding these categories of sound can
                  come in hand when creating an oral history exhibition. Taking
                  into account both the intentional and background sound that
                  will exist can help create a display of oral history that does
                  not completely overwhelm the visitor’s senses. Nikos Bubaris
                  makes a great point when discussing the stereotypes that come
                  with museums and their influence on exhibitions. For so long,
                  the idea that museums are places of silent reflection has been
                  a pervasive idea for those visiting and working in museums.
                  Bubaris makes note that, believing a public space should be
                  silent makes sound a big issue from the outset of designing
                  the exhibit. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Bubaris 2014, 391</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Bubaris, Nikos. “Sound in Museums - Museums in Sound.”

                      391-402. Web.</span></cite>) How is there supposed to be a good balance between the
                  diegetic and non-diegetic sounds in the museum if it is
                  believed by both workers and visitors that any background
                  noise should not exist? As museums shift to being a more sound
                  inclusive space, a push toward the idea that sound is present
                  and welcome in museums, oral history might find an easier path
                  into museums that might previously have shied away from the
                  sound in favor of silence.

                  Gould discusses an exhibit that came to be without the use of
                  video and audio, but rather the oral history interviews were
                  transcribed and written on panels throughout the space. A
                  great question Gould asks, “Could it be that video is easier
                  to ignore than the written word?” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Gould 2016</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Gould, Sarah Zenaida. “Challenges in exhibiting Oral

                  in the background at stores and restaurants, or video on while
                  scrolling on phones. It can be easy to miss a video or audio
                  portion of an exhibit when so often a person is already
                  surrounded my pre-recorded noises. This issue that arises when
                  displaying oral history should not dissuade curators from
                  utilizing oral history within their exhibits. It should
                  encourage them to think outside what has already been tried,
                  what has already not worked out. The beauty of oral history
                  comes from its unique abilities to share personal stories,
                  firsthand accounts from those who lived the experience an
                  exhibit is trying to display. Excluding oral history from
                  exhibitions purely because it is challenging is not good
                  practice, curators display challenging history and ideas
                  constantly, this should not be the exception.

                  The Anacostia Community Museum in Washington, D.C. is an
                  example of utilizing oral history inside an exhibition in a
                  meaningful way. The museum’s curator, Rachel Seidman, created
                  an exhibit about women and environmental justice in
                  Washington, D.C. and does a beautiful job of getting real
                  stories from community members and including them in the
                  exhibit. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Anacostia 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Anacostia Community Museum. “To Live and Breathe: Women

                  correlate. At the Anacostia Community Museum, the objects have
                  obvious stories, they have obvious significance. There is a
                  pair of boots from a woman who works in aquaculture, a male
                  dominated industry. Her boots, along with a quote from an oral
                  history interview next to the boots, gives them a tangible
                  meaning to those visiting. Her voice telling the story is what
                  makes the object so special. Oral history is a connection to a
                  story straight from the source. Rather than just get
                  information on how women are impacted by these environmental
                  injustices, we as visitors, see exactly how it impacts real
                  people. It is no longer an idea, but a reality that we see in
                  the lives of those showcased in the exhibit. The fishing boot
                  is just a boot in a case without the history, the story,
                  behind them. The Anacostia Community Museum took real stories
                  and included them in the exhibition. While visiting the
                  museum, Seidman discussed with my group the importance of
                  connection when working with oral history in communities. The
                  women’s stories she told in the exhibit are a vitally
                  important part in telling the story of environmental injustice
                  in DC, the whole concept of the exhibit. The same can be said
                  for oral history inside other exhibits. The information that
                  can be learned from an oral history interview can create an
                  exhibit all on its own. Even still, utilizing oral history in
                  combination with an existing idea can bring about a new level
                  on connection. Real people, real stories, can put visitors
                  that much closer to understanding and caring about the exhibit
                  they visited. The Anacostia Community Museum does an amazing
                  job when it comes to including oral history. Knowing that it
                  is possible is an encouragement to all curators that oral
                  history can work in exhibit space and be intriguing in exhibit
                  space.

                <p>
                  Steffi de Jong writes about a man, Kurt Tucholsky, visiting
                  the First World War Museum and feeling that it was missing the
                  realities of the war. There were just recreations, pictures
                  and posters, improvised shoes made out of newspapers inside
                  the museum; nothing that spoke to the horrors of war, nothing
                  that brought any emotion into the equation. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">de Jong 2018, 110</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">de Jong, Steffi. “Exhibiting: The Witness to History as a

                  inadequate in telling the real story. An object is just
                  another object without a story behind it. Today, museums
                  utilize the story behind objects in many exhibitions. They
                  give reference to an example of when an old object might have
                  been used. Or they recreate the style of clothing that may
                  have been worn during a specific time period. Utilizing oral
                  histories can give views a true experience in which an object
                  was used. A camera that ‘may have been used during this war’
                  is interesting to many on its own because it is old and from a
                  different time. But seeing that a camera was used by a soldier
                  during a war and captured images of the conflict might bring
                  about a more solid, human connection to the object. As stated
                  previously, objects do not really mean much without a human
                  connection to them. Oral history can provide an incredible
                  story to an object. But that is not all oral history can do.
                  Oral history in itself is a great resource for museums.

                <p>
                  The use of oral history in museums has taken a course that
                  leads visitors to a better understanding of real human
                  experience when they step inside the exhibit. It is being
                  utilized in museums in new and interesting ways. It is getting
                  collected by many different oral historians. It is getting
                  collected from varied groups on various topics. With so much
                  oral history being collected and museums already utilizing it
                  in the exhibitions, museums are well on their way to making
                  oral history exhibitions a staple of museums. As the field
                  progresses to be more sound inclusive, oral history audio and
                  video recordings shift from being too loud or distracting to
                  an integral part of the sound landscape. The increase in
                  collecting oral history allows for both historical and more
                  contemporary first-hand accounts of experiences being
                  presented in museums. With incredible examples like the
                  Anacostia Community Museum to lead the way and visitors like
                  me, that see a human connection to the material through oral
                  history as something intriguing and engaging, oral history
                  exhibits are sure to be popping up more in the near future.

                  The Holocaust is the history of great tragedy and trauma. The
                  Holocaust claimed the lives of over six million European Jews
                  and over five million non-Jewish people. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 2</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Holocaust

                  industrialized the killing of those they considered a threat.
                  The main focus of their destruction were the Jewish people of
                  Germany and the countries that they conquered. As the war was
                  concluding the Allied forces came across the concentration
                  camps where much of the industrialized killing took place.
                  Though the Nazis tried to disguise the purpose of such camps
                  and their deeds, the survivors found clinging to life in the
                  camps were clear evidence of what the Nazis tried to hide.

                  After the end of World War II, the documentation of the extent
                  of the Nazi’s atrocities began. While in the final stages of
                  the war Nazi soldiers attempted to destroy the evidence of
                  what had occurred, there was much documentation of the
                  Holocaust remaining for the Allies to discover. Documentation
                  and the physical sites were important in discovering the scale
                  and inner workings of the Final Solution, however, the
                  survivors themselves were a key resource to understanding the
                  horrors that were inflicted. Many of the survivors have spent
                  a great deal of their time after the Holocaust detailing what
                  exactly happened to them during the war. Whether through
                  written means, a journal, or an article, or through talks that
                  they give to those willing to listen. The documentation given
                  by the survivors is an extremely powerful tool to combat the
                  ever-growing denial of the Holocaust. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 1</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Holocaust

                  Despite the large volume of evidence, both physical and oral,
                  denial of the Holocaust has existed since the beginning stages
                  of the discovery. At first it was the Nazis attempting to save
                  themselves from the punishments for the atrocities they had
                  committed. However, even so many decades past the event, there
                  are a great deal more deniers than ever. Widespread
                  disinformation has been disseminated by the internet,
                  contributing to the growing problem. Much of this denial
                  centers around discrediting the survivors and witnesses. Those
                  who deny the Holocaust tend to downplay what happened and
                  minimize what losses happened if they do say that any happened
                  at all. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 1</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Holocaust

                  strongest tools to push back against the deniers is the voices
                  and stories of the survivors.

                  Ever since the end of the war many organizations have created
                  ways to record the stories of those who witnessed the events
                  that took place. With the improvements in technology, digital
                  recordings have provided a way to preserve the voices and
                  faces of those telling the harrowing stories of survival and
                  pain. With the numbers of survivors ever dwindling, these
                  recordings are extremely important to preserve the words and
                  emotions felt by the survivors. Recording the stories has
                  enabled a great deal of information to be kept safe from the
                  decay of memory and the destruction of physical evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the written word is powerful, an oral history recording
                  helps to preserve the emotions in the voice and the face of
                  the speaker. These emotions help evoke empathy and sympathy
                  from the viewer in a stronger way than the written word.

                  the Holocaust and those who did and did not survive it. They
                  also have a great deal of objects that can help tell the story
                  of the Holocaust. Many of the documentary and video-based
                  evidence is digitized. Their website has a page dedicated to
                  connecting viewers to different types of records to give
                  different perspectives and information. These include written
                  documentation and recorded videos of survivor’s testimony. As
                  well as the online archive on their website, the USHMM also
                  has a YouTube channel where they share videos, lectures, and
                  eye-witness accounts.

                <h2>The YouTube Channel</h2>
                <p>
                  The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s YouTube channel
                  was started in 2006, with their first video being in 2007.
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Wong 2011, 104</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Wong, Amelia S. “Ethical Issues of Social Media in

                  useful tool for many years. From the beginning the videos had
                  a strong focus on communicating the oral stories of those who
                  survived. Starting in 2013 videos (<a href="#page-https-www-youtube-com-watch-v-tdiutwfjzzc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdiuTwfJZzc</a>) on the USHMM’s YouTube channel started to make use of
                  livestream technology to broadcast interviews and talks to a
                  wider audience than those who were able to make the lecture in
                  person. Today the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
                  maintains a strong presence on YouTube, posting some form of
                  content around twice a month. While survivor stories are
                  featured heavily, the YouTube channel does feature objects
                  from their collection, historian talks, stories of other
                  genocides, and many other types of videos. The large range of
                  content on their channel follows the USHMM’s mission to
                  “advance and disseminate knowledge.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 3</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Mission and

                  platform, a place that is easily found through internet
                  searches on the topic of the Holocaust, the United States
                  Holocaust Memorial Museum is able to reach out to a wider
                  audience than if they had kept all of their videos solely on
                  their website.
                </p>
                <p>
                  YouTube as a platform has multiple advantages making it a good
                  place for the USHMM to share and store videos on. By using
                  YouTube as a host, the USHMM is not bearing the burden of
                  storage for these videos. YouTube itself is an incredibly
                  successful and popular video sharing website so using it as a
                  platform can help increase engagement. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Wong 2011, 104</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Wong, Amelia S. “Ethical Issues of Social Media in

                  denial. In 2019 the platform banned speech that denied the
                  Holocaust. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Guhl and Davey 2020, 2</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Guhl, Jakob and Jacob Davey, “Hosting the ‘Holohoax’: A

                  certain buzzwords that were used in many of the videos and
                  comments that denied the Holocaust on the platform. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Guhl and Davey 2020, 9</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Guhl, Jakob and Jacob Davey, “Hosting the ‘Holohoax’: A

                  of the comment section of the USHMM’s videos much easier as
                  the platform’s policies now fully support such actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Institutions dealing with such heavy topics such as the
                  Holocaust, especially when the truth of the events are
                  directly under attack, need to curate their digital media
                  carefully. The decision on whether to allow dialogue in
                  comments under the videos is an important idea. Dialogue is a
                  good way to encourage public engagement with the content
                  produced, however, dialogue can bring in people acting in bad
                  faith. If only positive comments are allowed, this can be seen
                  as censorship of certain viewpoints. While perusing the
                  comments on the YouTube channel of the United States Holocaust
                  Memorial Museum I only saw positive comments, whether this is
                  due to their curation of the comment section or to the fact
                  that only those who are interested in the topic for positive
                  education are seeking out this information is unknown.
                  According to Amelia Wong, who had moderated the comments for
                  the USHMM’s YouTube channel, a set of criteria was developed
                  to prevent abuse, denial, and hate from spreading through the
                  comments on their videos. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Wong 2011, 104</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Wong, Amelia S. “Ethical Issues of Social Media in

                      (2011): 97-112, doi:10.1080/09647775.2011.566710.</span></cite>) Wong’s article on the social media of the USHMM was written
                  before the changes of YouTube’s terms of service in 2019, so
                  it is unclear what exactly the affect of the changes have been
                  to the channel in general, but the current state of the
                  comments shows that a similar trend of keeping up the
                  positivity is continuing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since the conflict between Israel and Palestine broke out in
                  late 2023 all of their latest videos have had the comments
                  turned off. This could have been a preemptive attempt to avoid
                  conflict in the comments, or a response to comments that were
                  made as the conflict began in earnest. Either way, clearly the
                  moderators of the YouTube channel have had to adjust their
                  strategy based on the current events happening in Israel.
                  While silencing the ability for discussion is something that
                  Wong had written was not something that the USHMM was
                  interested in, clearly the conflict has created a need for
                  extra protections and safeguards for the channel’s health.

                  A newer part of the USHMM’s channel is the inclusion of
                  shorts. YouTube Shorts are videos that are of 60 seconds or
                  less duration. Shorts are YouTube’s attempt to find the
                  popularity of Vine or TikTok with the short video format.
                  Often these short video formats are used to grab the attention
                  for a brief period before moving on to the next video. While
                  shorts are an interesting approach to appealing to the
                  attention span of the current generation, some might think
                  that they are lacking the context needed to fully understand
                  the story. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Pagenstecher 2018, 117</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Pagenstecher, Cord. “Testimonies in Digital Environments:

                      <em>Oral History</em> 46, no. 2 (2018): 109-18,

                  to be generally less meaningful and less engaging than what
                  the subject matter seems to dictate. The USHMM has used the
                  format of the Short in a couple different ways, some of which
                  seem to fit the tone of the rest of the channel, while one
                  series of three videos does not.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Majority of the shorts on the channel are the videos in the
                  series “Truth Is…”. These shorts focus on the physical
                  evidence left behind by the Holocaust. In the 60 second videos
                  an object is presented by the survivor that it is attached to.
                  The survivor describes the object and how it shows the truth
                  of their story. The objects range from a photograph of their
                  family to a doll, to an ID card. The wide range of objects,
                  from innocent to sinister show the true scope of how people
                  were affected by the Holocaust and the memories that were
                  tainted by it. There are a couple of videos that tell the
                  stories of victims and survivors but without narration,
                  relying solely on text to give context to the images shown.
                  Overall, these fit the general theme of the rest of the
                  YouTube channel, using the survivors’ stories to explore the
                  truth in the history of the Holocaust.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are three shorts that drastically deviate from the rest
                  of the videos. The first being
                  <a href="#page-https-www-youtube-com-shorts-futt71kag5s" target="_blank">“Submit Your Questions to Andrew (Andy)”</a>
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM Youtube 2</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Submit Your

                  answering two questions that were posed in the comments of the
                  first short. This type of question-and-answer video is fairly
                  common in the short form video format. However, to me this
                  format feels very lighthearted and lacking the gravity that
                  the rest of the channel provides. The two questions that Mr.
                  Jampoler answered,

                  drastic difference in the tone and style of the video was
                  quite jarring. The short format of the video did not allow for
                  Mr. Jampoler to elaborate on his answers, nor even to finish
                  his thoughts as the first of the two answers was cut off due
                  to the short format.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While a question-and-answer format would be a good way to
                  continue to educate the audience of the YouTube channel, using
                  the Shorts question and answer format would be a mistake. With
                  the live technology that the USHMM has been using for many
                  years already, a question-and-answer livestream would allow
                  for a more natural flow and for the answers to be complete and
                  fully fleshed out. Overall, the Shorts format does not fully
                  remove the context as some might worry it would, but only if
                  the videos are very carefully crafted. The biggest problem
                  would be the fact that these shorts can be mixed into the
                  algorithm and be shown in the middle of inappropriate videos
                  given the content and theme of the USHMM’s Shorts.

                <p>
                  As time moves forward the available living memory of the
                  Holocaust shrinks. Survivors die out and their voices and
                  testimonies are lost. We find ourselves further and further
                  removed from the horrors of the Holocaust. As the twenty-first
                  century proceeds, humanity finds itself facing one crisis
                  after another. This constant flood of trauma and pain through
                  the media has desensitized the general populace to such
                  horrors. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Clark 2005, 266</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Clark, Mary Marshall. “Holocaust Video Testimony, Oral

                  Social media platforms operate based on continuous bombardment
                  of information and media that has led to mental fatigue and
                  lack of attention span in its users. This lack of attention
                  can lead to issues with the proper contextualization of the
                  trauma and the pain that the videos of the USHMM are trying to
                  convey. While the visual imagery of the survivor telling their
                  story is powerful, the indifference of a modern or future
                  viewer may render all of the effort pointless.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With modern pain dulling the shock of the past, how can
                  institutions like the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
                  keep modern audiences engaged with their message? Their
                  YouTube series
                  <a href="#page-https-www-youtube-com-playlist-list-plwqc3p4pszp4-difjjcrahhzywxkkcv29" target="_blank">Eyewitness to History</a>
                  is a treasured archive of the testimonies of the survivors of
                  the Holocaust. The engagement with the videos is often
                  positive, however the previous curation of the comment section
                  and the current disabling of comments, makes it difficult to
                  know what exactly the engagement of the channel is. With the
                  current conflict in Palestine causing a great deal of
                  attention to be drawn to the subject of the Holocaust, there
                  is as great a need as ever for channels like the USHMM to
                  continue producing content that can get through the mental
                  fatigue and grab the attention of those searching for
                  information. By using YouTube Shorts, the USHMM has a chance
                  to take advantage of the short form media to transmit small
                  snippets of information to an audience that may not have been
                  seeking out information directly like with their other videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With evolving media technologies and strategies, the USHMM
                  seems primed to continue using social media and digital
                  content to spread awareness and education. With continued use
                  of their digital collections and carefully curated content,
                  there is a great deal of possibility in their YouTube channel.
                  The use of Shorts may assist in their ability to reach a
                  previously untapped audience, as the YouTube algorithm works
                  its magic. As long as the social media curators continue to
                  respect the tone and themes that they are bound by, there is a
                  lot that can be achieved by their current model.

                  With the development of technology, the typical museum visit
                  has evolved. The inclusion of hands-on or immersive technology
                  into museums is more commonplace than ever. Especially after
                  the pandemic, museums are looking to maintain the visitor
                  numbers by creating unique and interesting experiences.
                  Meanwhile, game-based learning has been understood for decades
                  to be beneficial to learners in a multitude of settings.
                  Whether in the classroom or informal learning environments
                  like museums, adding games to enhance learning has shown to
                  increase interest and retention. With ever-improving
                  technology, video games have been more widely accepted as a
                  possible tool for education. Another way museums are looking
                  to attract more visitors is through partnerships with
                  recognizable video game and media brands. There are three
                  exhibits that are currently on view that are partnerships
                  between museums and recognizable franchises. The three
                  partnerships are with the established franchises of Roblox,
                  Pokémon, and Animal Crossing. The partnerships range in scope,
                  from special exhibits to experiences that span the whole
                  museum. They also range in output from programs that are
                  mostly promotional to more of a game-based learning model.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the pervasive stigma that video games are only for
                  kids, the original audience for video games who grew up in the
                  80s and 90s are aging and now have kids of their own. Many of
                  the game franchises that are available now have been on the
                  market for multiple decades, with an enduring fan base. Museum
                  partnerships like those with Pokémon or games developed by
                  Nintendo, brands that have been popular for 30 years, have the
                  potential to bridge generations and create connections.
                  Connections that could add to a museum visit, if also well
                  designed and educational. With partnerships like that with
                  Roblox, the nostalgia factor is most likely not there, but
                  that does not limit the multigenerational potential of newer
                  games. If the game elements are intriguing enough, the whole
                  family can learn together, both the game and the educational
                  material.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though video games are played by many ages, these three
                  franchises are very popular with younger demographics. This
                  brand recognition can attract families with children, and lead
                  to the exposure of museums and museum learning to younger
                  people. The learning potential of a museum when in conjunction
                  with the resources and technological infrastructure that the
                  game companies supply could be indicative of what could be
                  possible for the future of game-based museum learning to
                  enhance museum visitor experience.

                  with the new violent games of the decade and in many ways

                <h3><em>Roblox</em> at the Metropolitan Museum</h3>
                <p>
                  In collaboration with <em>Roblox</em>, the Met launched its
                  own app, called <em>Replica</em> in 2023.
                  <em>Replica</em> uses augmented reality (AR) that takes
                  advantage of the programmable nature of <em>Roblox</em>,
                  encouraging players to “collect” art and objects at the Met.
                  The <em>Roblox</em> partnership is not tied to a specific
                  exhibit, but instead uses a select amount of pieces throughout
                  the whole museum The player can walk around the museum with a
                  smart device and “scan” the available objects with the
                  device’s camera. To find the available objects, the app
                  includes a museum map and geolocation feature that senses when
                  the player is close to an available object. Once in the
                  correct room, the app also provides written clues and a
                  silhouette to help the player find the specific object. These
                  scavenger hunt-like features encourage discovery and
                  close-looking at the objects in the galleries. With some of
                  the pieces, such as the armor, the players can transfer them
                  to their <em>Roblox</em> account, enabling their virtual
                  avatar to wear the objects from the museum, creating an
                  interactive element beyond the trip to the museum.

                  The “sandbox” nature of <em>Roblox</em> has allowed for many
                  educational possibilities including those currently available
                  for the Metropolitan Museum in New York. <em>Roblox</em> is
                  one of the newer games to reach mass popularity status. Much
                  like the also massively popular game, <em>Minecraft</em>,
                  <em>Roblox</em> is a very flexible “sandbox” or open world
                  game. A sandbox game is one where players are able to build
                  their own experiences through programming. Despite being
                  developed decades ago, it only gained popularity in the late
                  2010’s especially with the under 12 demographic. Additionally,
                  <em>Roblox</em> exploded in popularity during the Covid-19
                  pandemic due to the ability to interact virtually with
                  friends. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Liao, 2020</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Liao, Shannon. “How Roblox became the ‘it’ game for

                  The players are able to wander the museum at their own
                  leisure, not following a set path, and discover the pieces
                  included in the game. Also maintaining the element of
                  engagement as there is a set amount of objects to collect and
                  the added benefit of having the objects be digitally
                  functional after their visit to the Met. The player is
                  motivated to collect as many museum objects as they can The
                  adaptability and graceful failure are maintained as well, but
                  more subtly. The silhouette and clues for the objects can
                  apply to multiple pieces, and because the Met’s collection is
                  so large and diverse, one set of armor, for example, might be
                  confused with another.

                  To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Amsterdam’s Van Gogh
                  Museum, <em>Pokémon</em> partnered with the museum on an

                  In its 30-year history, <em>Pokémon</em> became a behemoth of

                  started in the 1990’s and has managed to maintain its cultural
                  relevance. The youngest target audience for
                  <em>Pokémon</em> is in the 8-12 year old range. However due to
                  its long staying power, the earliest fans are well into their

                  The exhibit, titled, “<em>Pokémon</em> at Van Gogh Museum,”
                  opened in September 2023, and runs until January 2024. Though
                  not an obvious pairing off the bat, it is meant to reflect the
                  appreciation that Van Gogh had for Japanese art during his
                  lifetime. The special exhibit includes 6 works of art, where
                  <em>Pokémon</em> are included in paintings inspired by Van
                  Gogh’s more notable works. There are two activities in the
                  exhibit. One includes instructions on how to draw Pikachu, the
                  most identifiable character in the franchise. The other
                  involves details and facts about Van Gogh’s life and his
                  relationship with Japanese art as described in a letter he
                  wrote to his brother. Additionally, there is a limited time
                  <em>Pokémon</em> card of Pikachu in the style of a Van Gogh
                  self-portrait sold in the museum’s gift shop. Since the
                  opening of the exhibit, the card was so popular that it sold
                  out quickly. The museum had to subsequently cancel the restock
                  due to “safety concerns” because the museum shop was being
                  mobbed by “alleged scalpers”. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Wong, 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Wong, Vicky. 2023. “Van Gogh Museum pulls Pokémon card

                  ability to bring people to the museum shows the power that
                  these partnerships can have for museum attendance.

                  At the time of writing, the exhibit is still ongoing, and
                  therefore, the results are still to be determined. However,
                  there is lost opportunity in the offerings of the partnership.
                  The two activities and the limited-edition card, though
                  interesting, could have been more interactive or immersive
                  using an existing <em>Pokémon</em> video game. In 2016,
                  <em>Pokémon</em> developed the massively popular
                  <em>Pokémon GO</em>, an AR game that was accessible on

                  with the Van Gogh Museum. Following the games meteoric rise in

                  Another example similar to that of <em>Pokémon</em> at Van
                  Gogh is <em>Animal Crossing</em> at the Seattle Aquarium.
                  <em>Animal Crossing</em> is a game series developed by
                  Nintendo. They are life and social simulation games, where
                  players take on the role of a character who moves to a virtual
                  village or island populated by anthropomorphic animals. The
                  aim of the game is for the player to develop and beautify
                  their own village or island by growing fruit and vegetables
                  and to develop friendships with the non-player characters. The
                  most recent <em>Animal Crossing</em> game,
                  <em>New Horizons</em>, came out in March of 2020. With
                  everyone scared and stuck at home during the COVID 19

                  that the game runs in real-time; the in-game time and seasons
                  mirror those of the real world. Seasonal events, and different
                  fish and insects become available at different times of the
                  day and year, encouraging players to visit regularly and
                  experience the game’s changing world. Interestingly, there is
                  a museum in the game where the players can collect and donate
                  fish, insects, fossils and art to put on display. All the
                  donated specimens and objects are based on real-world ones,
                  and when donated, the in-game curator, an owl named Blathers,
                  will share facts about the donation.

                  The partnership with the Seattle Aquarium runs from October
                  2023-January 2024 and includes photo opportunities with
                  standees of the notable characters, animal facts that are the
                  same as the ones for the in-game museum, and a “bingo
                  scavenger hunt” that visitors can play on a smart device.

                  that are in the game as well as in a selected tank at the
                  aquarium. The scavenger hunt is a good addition to the
                  offerings, allowing for a collaborative element with kids and
                  their grown-ups. There is a potential for the programming to
                  evolve, as the aquarium does promise more activities as it
                  continues.

                  Much like the partnership with <em>Pokémon</em> and Van Gogh,
                  The Seattle Aquarium’s partnership with
                  <em>Animal Crossing</em> is mainly promotional. To either get
                  fans of the game interested in the aquarium or fans of the
                  aquarium interested in the game. Also like with the
                  partnership with <em>Pokémon</em> and the Van Gogh Museum,
                  there are some lost opportunities.
                  <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizon</em> uses game-based learning
                  strategies in its motivation and engagement as it is a
                  progression of tasks toward a larger goal, while continually
                  learning about the animals that the player catches or objects
                  they collect. The game also uses some elements of adaptivity
                  and graceful failing, as bugs and fish can escape from the
                  player. These game-based learning strategies from the video
                  game would benefit the collaboration. The age range for
                  players in 3 years old and up, which might account for the
                  simplistic offerings of the partnership. There was the
                  potential to add more content to what was already available in
                  the game. Perhaps even add some virtual or interactive
                  elements for other immersive experiences that might mimic the
                  game play and the game-based learning.

                <h2>What Can We Learn?</h2>
                <p>
                  Video games of any kind are a difficult product to produce.
                  Especially with any specificity of subject matter that also
                  meets the standards for successful game-based learning. For
                  both the museum and game-companies, creating a game for a
                  specific location or exhibit is expensive, and takes specific
                  technological understanding. Some museums have made their own
                  video games that engage players either virtually or in the
                  museum’s physical space. For example the Centre Pompidou in
                  Paris launched their own video game, <em>Prisme 7</em>, in
                  2020. Expanding the definition of museum beyond that of
                  physical space is one of the ways that museums can stay
                  relevant in an increasingly technological world. With the
                  financial and technological help of a recognizable game
                  franchise, there is the possibility of more advanced
                  technologies to be included in museum game-based learning
                  events and exhibits in the future like augmented reality (AR)
                  and virtual reality (VR), or artificial intelligence (AI).
                  These technological advancements might be difficult for
                  museums to achieve by themselves, due to tight budgets and
                  finite resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the visitor, a main limitation is that of accessibility.
                  For many of these partnerships, a device is required in order
                  to engage. This can create a barrier for those museum visitors
                  without access to a smart device, or without the ability to
                  lend one to their children. This excludes lower income
                  visitors, and visitors who are not tech-savvy. These
                  limitations are hard and expensive to overcome, as they do
                  require the museum or game company to provide some sort of
                  interactive technology. There also are drawbacks to immersive
                  technology-based experiences in museums. The increased foot
                  traffic of people who are immersed in their screens rather
                  than the objects in front of them can be a detractor to the
                  experience for people who prefer to enjoy a museum in a
                  traditional way. For families specifically, with an
                  increasingly virtual world, limiting their children’s screen
                  time might also be a priority, and therefore might want to
                  avoid exhibits and museum programs that center around more
                  screens.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  The educational possibilities for game-based learning in
                  museums is ever evolving, especially with the addition of ever
                  evolving technology. Current partnerships with museums and
                  large video game franchises are utilizing those possibilities
                  to varying degrees of success. <em>Roblox</em> and the Met’s
                  development of <em>Replica</em> is a successful case of
                  utilizing game-based learning factors of motivation,
                  engagement, alterability and graceful failure.
                  <em>Pokémon</em> and <em>Animal Crossing</em> had the
                  potential to be educationally engaging as well as promotional.
                  The hope of including game-based learning where a game is
                  integrated into a place of learning, not quite fulfilled with
                  the examples at the Van Gogh Museum and Seattle Aquarium.
                  These two examples and the inclusion of game brand-specific
                  content in the museum could be the first step toward their
                  further integration of major popular media into the museum
                  landscape. However, these kinds of partnerships are also a
                  possible step toward future collaborations where technology
                  and education can create a unique and engaging experience for
                  the visitor.

                          Nichole Nappi, a George Washington University Museum
                          Studies graduate student, is an organized, driven
                          soon-to-be tech savvy provenance researcher devoted to
                          documenting and digitizing collections. Having already
                          graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Art with a computer
                          graphics concentration, Nichole is dedicating the next
                          phase of her life to the museum field. When she’s not
                          in Arlington, Virginia, Nichole enjoys being with her
                          loving husband, Mark, and her son, Nicholas.
