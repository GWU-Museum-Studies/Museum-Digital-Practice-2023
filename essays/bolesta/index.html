                  When interpreting historic sites and ruins, a lot of trust is
                  placed in the imagination of the visitor. A docent may
                  describe the rolling fields of a plantation with communities
                  of slave houses dotting the landscape, or the remainder of a
                  Greek temple which has long since been destroyed; but
                  ultimately their description only provides an outline, and
                  they can only hope they have provided enough detail that the
                  visitor can mentally paint in the rest of the picture.
                  Reconstructions can eliminate this subjectivity, but are
                  costly, and run the risk of damaging the historic resources
                  they are trying to aid. Artistic depictions provide detail,
                  but cannot be overlain on the landscape, resulting in visitors
                  having to look back and forth between location and signage,
                  breaking their immersion in the space. But picture, if with
                  the press of a button a structure could appear, the gaps on a
                  temple would be filled in, and a full landscape could be seen
                  in context. That without relying on disparate imaginations a
                  museum could temporarily display a reconstruction, without
                  jeopardizing the existing features above or below ground. And
                  being able to show all of this not to one person at a time
                  with the use of goggles or screens, but to a crowd, who can
                  examine and analyze together. The possibilities for
                  interpretation, collaboration, and understanding could grow
                  exponentially with the use of one developing technology. I am
                  speaking, of course, of holograms.

                <p>
                  To start, we should define our subject. Far from being a
                  technological marvel, humanity has had “holograms” for nearly
                  eight decades now. While science fiction calls to mind images
                  of Princess Leia being projected by R2-D2 in 1977’s
                  <em>Star Wars</em>, (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Lucas 1977</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Lucas, George, dir. <em>Star Wars: A New Hope</em>. 1977;
                      Beverly Hills, CA: 20th Century Fox.</span></cite>) the reality is much more mundane. In 1971, Dennis Gabor won
                  a Nobel Peace prize for his 1947 work utilizing the
                  interference of light waves to print a three-dimensional image
                  on a two dimensional surface,(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Nobel Prize 1971</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">NobelPrize.org. “The Nobel Prize in Physics 1971.”

                  awe today, his hologram images birthed the technical

                  this definition issue at their annual forum in 2019,
                  commenting that the advent of augmented reality (AR), virtual
                  reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR) have further complicated
                  hologram terminology, with all four terms being used
                  interchangeably by different researchers for increasingly
                  similar technologies. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Deakes 2019</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Deakes, Mark. “The Changing Meaning of the Word

                  display a three-dimensional image to the viewer, but do not

                  Gabor, Leith, and Upatnieks’ work, adding that the resulting
                  image must be able to be seen “without any special equipment,
                  such as cameras or glasses.”(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Byers 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Byers, Kirsty. “The Importance of Holograms and How They

                  inherent three-dimensional presentation of all holograms, into
                  something with the actual presence of height, width, and
                  depth, and not just the illusory appearance of it.
                  Furthermore, this volumetric display, to match our science
                  fiction ideal, should be able to be projected into free space,
                  rather than onto a screen or an enclosure. As such, throughout
                  this research the term “volumetric hologram” will be utilized,
                  as it appears to be the semantic middle ground between popular
                  understanding and scientific research.

                <h2>Overcoming the Laws of Light</h2>
                <p>
                  At present volumetric hologram technology is still science
                  fiction, foiled by real-world physics and the scientific
                  properties of light, however, ingenious solutions are being
                  developed by artists and engineers worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The greatest obstacle to a truly freestanding volumetric
                  hologram lies in an issue with the most basic principle of how
                  light works. For most wavelengths of light to be seen by the
                  naked eye, they have to bounce off something. Open air
                  provides little for light to bounce off of. This inherent
                  fault has led to the development of the “faux” holograms
                  discussed earlier, either through augmented reality, virtual
                  reality, or through more traditional methods such as
                  projection onto a screen. However, these are merely illusions
                  of three-dimensional space, with no actual volume. As such,
                  three potential solutions have been developed to overcome this
                  fundamental law of light: water, gas, and plasma.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The water and gas solutions are operationally different, but
                  create similar results. In these methods, a fine mist of water
                  or concentration of gas is released into an area where the
                  volumetric hologram is to be displayed, providing an
                  invisible, multidimensional surface for light to bounce off at
                  different points and vectors. French artist Joanie Lemercier
                  has been pioneering the water method, creating interactive
                  projections in mist.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Mashable Deals 2018</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Mashable Deals. “Closest Thing We Have to Holograms Right

                  phases, and work better as a proof of concept than as
                  actionable technology. Gas has been utilized as a medium
                  primarily in scientific laboratories, but has been successful
                  in producing a small, but fully volumetric, hologram.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Gu 2004</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Gu, Yuhan, Shigang Wan, Qing Liu, and Changqing Ye.

                  they must also manage the natural state of those variables.
                  Gas, by its nature, matches the shape and volume of whatever
                  container it is in. As such, this method is only possible for
                  enclosed spaces, and with such concentrations required for the
                  display that it is unlikely humans would be able to enter
                  them. It’s perfectly functional for small scale volumetric
                  holograms, but an impossible option when discussing large or
                  outdoor displays. Furthermore, in the context of historic
                  sites and ruins, fine mists of water or particulates begin to
                  risk preservation concerns to the exposed historic features,
                  and should be approached with care.

                  So, how do you project without a screen or particulate to
                  project onto? The plasma method from Japanese firm Aerial
                  Burton offers another solution to this issue, developing a
                  system to project images directly into the air.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Edwards 2014</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Edwards, Luke. “Holograms Are Finally Here: Plasma Lasers

                  utilized. This is accomplished via an ultra-precise pulse
                  laser ionizing specific air particles to create small plasma
                  bursts. These bursts only last a nanosecond, but the resulting
                  points of light form the boundaries of a shape, freely
                  floating in midair. While this technology is by no means
                  perfect, it is a consequential first step towards the
                  development of volumetric displays.

                  Still then, lies the question of the potential applications of
                  these volumetric holograms. Two-dimensional projection
                  holograms have already been established in museums around the
                  world, almost exclusively in small, indoor exhibits. The 19th
                  century Pepper’s Ghost Effect (Figure 2), popularized by theme
                  park attractions such as Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion, has
                  been increasingly utilized in museums to display animals or
                  people inside of exhibit cases, interacting with collections
                  objects without actually touching them (Figure 3).(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">HOLOCO 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">HOLOCO GmbH. “3D Hologram for Museum,” November 8, 2022.

                  has been strong, and the interactions are seen as invaluable
                  to the experience.(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Wolff 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Wolff, Sierra. “Illinois Holocaust Museum &amp; Education

                  present to the visitor within the walls and boundaries of the

                  What becomes possible with volumetric holograms is the
                  large-scale interpretation of historic landscapes. Landscape
                  interpretation always takes a measure of creative
                  interpretation for museums and historic sites, especially in
                  cases where the historic features are no longer standing.
                  Ruins themselves tell a story, but interpretive narratives are
                  limited when the full scale of a historic scene is absent from
                  view. Descriptions or photographs encourage visitors to use
                  their imaginations to envision long absent vistas or the
                  former grandeur of an estate, but a barren landscape stands
                  antithetical to this view. Reconstructions are costly, run the
                  risk of damaging the remaining ruins or subsurface features of
                  a site, and they cannot be changed after being built, meaning
                  the later discovery of any inaccuracies cannot be addressed.
                  While virtual reality provides some answers to these issues,
                  the virtual reconstruction of the world the viewer enters into
                  inherently separates them from the historical landscape and
                  features they are standing amidst. Augmented reality works to
                  bridge this gap, but still separates the viewer from the
                  subject through goggles or a handheld screen. What volumetric
                  holograms might provide , that these other technologies do
                  not, is the ability to project into space the form of a
                  structure, or missing parts of a ruin, and have that visible
                  in real time as an extension of the landscape around the
                  viewer, rather than replacing it.

                  So far, we’ve mainly seen the replication of small objects
                  inside of exhibits, as in the examples discussed above, but
                  imagine how much more could be done with a change in scale.
                  With volumetric holograms, ruined structures, buildings,
                  churches, and so on could be displayed at their full form, not
                  just as the remains currently extant. Historic houses,
                  befallen to fire or neglect, could have gaps filled in to give
                  an impression of the peak of their use. Ancient ruins of
                  structures or cities could be visible in their original
                  context, with spatial relationships and construction able to
                  be analyzed and interpreted relative to not only each other
                  but the landscape around it. Further extrapolating, entire
                  landscapes could benefit, visualizing slave structures on
                  historic plantations or fortification locations on
                  battlefields. Locations where archaeology, oral history, or
                  archival records identify that cultural resources lie could be
                  rebuilt without ever impacting the subsurface, or even making
                  a permanent change.

                  Large-scale holograms for landscape interpretation have a
                  variety of inherent drawbacks, even in their conceptual state.
                  To be worthwhile for museums, the ideal technology would
                  involve what the American Alliance of Museums has dubbed
                  “frictionless” technology:(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Davis 2020</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Davis, Matt. “Towards Frictionless Augmented Reality,”

                  can see without the use of assistive devices, and which they
                  can move around to examine at different angles. The technology
                  should be simple for museum staff to operate and maintain with
                  basic training, and without the help of an outside specialist,
                  ideally with something as simple as pressing a button or
                  running a software program. The machine hardware itself should
                  be built to survive outdoor environments, or have critical
                  components easily removable to protect from weather and theft.
                  For the purposes of this research, this will be the
                  established ideal, so as to limit the infinite possibilities
                  of technological advancement.

                  As the foundation of this entire concept revolves around
                  manipulation of light, immediately we must discuss what we’re
                  competing with; namely, the sun. Because research on
                  volumetric holograms is still ongoing, their ability to
                  project during daytime is largely speculation. The heated
                  plasma technology from Aerial Burton is shown working in
                  daylight,(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Aerial Burton 2014</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden=""><em>Aerial Burton 3D Display Projects Images into

                  earlier have almost universally been shown in darkened rooms
                  or after sunset. The limitations of the technology are largely
                  going to be based on which system is adopted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For museums, volumetric holograms which can be displayed in
                  the daylight are ideal, as it allows connection with the
                  largest number of visitors with the smallest inconvenience to
                  current operations. Those that can only be displayed at night
                  are limiting. In many public museums, this is outside of
                  normal opening hours, and would restrict viewing of any
                  reconstructions to special events or selected evenings. This
                  results in a familiar cost-benefit analysis for the museum; is
                  the cost of the technology offset by the public interest and
                  benefit to the museum’s mission? Luckily, there is precedent
                  for exactly this scenario.

                  both stand as partial ruins, long missing the paint and

                  reconstruction, the teams at both sites have digitally mapped
                  the face, curve, and flaws in every wall and column, utilizing

                  Now, it stands to reason that in light of this success,
                  projection mapping should be considered as the next great
                  frontier for museums. This is already well underway. Many
                  exhibits are already implementing projection mapping as an
                  integral part of their displays, including teamLab in Japan
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">teamLab</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“teamLab.” Accessed November 9, 2023.
                      <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/" target="_blank">https://www.teamlab.art/</a>.</span></cite>) and traveling exhibits such as the Van Gogh Experience.
                  (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Van Gogh Exhibition</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Van Gogh Exhibition: The Immersive Experience.” Accessed

                      <a href="https://vangoghexpo.com/" target="_blank">https://vangoghexpo.com/</a>.</span></cite>) However, there is a fundamental difference between this and
                  a volumetric hologram. If there are ruins or walls to project
                  onto projection mapping is a perfectly viable interpretive
                  tool, taking what we have historically relegated to the mind’s
                  eye and combining it with analytical archaeology or artistic
                  interpretation for a more complete picture. The light
                  projections utilized have something to bounce off to create an
                  image. But in the absence of such a backdrop, or any backdrop
                  at all, projection mapping falters. Bridging this gap is where
                  volumetric holograms become valuable for large scale
                  interpretation, where the absence of structures impacts the
                  efficacy of the story the museum is trying to relay to
                  visitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is critical however that these volumetric holograms assist
                  in interpretive efforts, not conflict with the existing
                  narrative of a site. The digital models must be as accurate
                  and well researched as any other part of museum
                  interpretation, working in tandem with existing exhibits and
                  tours to supplement the site’s story rather than replace it.
                  Dissonance between the two will only serve to confuse or
                  distract visitors. It is likely that three dimensional models
                  will need to be approached the same way as artistic drawings
                  are now; utilizing a combination of comparable historic sites
                  which are still standing, documentary research, and
                  excavation. In this case, the tools in the artist’s toolbox
                  are the things which change, exchanging pencil and paper for
                  programs like CAD and Blender. The freedom of interpretation
                  and artistic expression do not. From there, integrating the
                  resulting model is familiar ground for the museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once this initial hurdle is crossed, the next primary concern
                  is spatial accuracy. Any structures, landscape features, or
                  architectural details restored with light should ideally line
                  up with their historic counterparts, or else risk the same
                  dissonance in the understanding of the viewer as with an
                  inaccurate model. Again, however, this is not necessarily new
                  ground. Advancements with Global Positioning Systems (GPS),
                  Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Light Detection and
                  Ranging (LiDAR) have allowed for increasingly precise surveys
                  of features on the ground, which, when combined with
                  traditional research methods like Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps
                  and probate inventories, provide a picture of a historic
                  landscape which was unthinkable only a few decades ago. It is
                  likely that a good volumetric hologram, which is both
                  historically accurate and visually comprehensible, will need
                  to utilize both the broad accuracy measurements these provide
                  with the fine detail work of the dimensional modeling. As
                  such, it should come as a comfort that the technology for
                  these steps is already so well established.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also alluded to but left undiscussed in this research has been
                  the matter of cost. At present, the speculative technologies
                  discussed in this paper are prototypes and proofs of concepts,
                  with no associated costs publicly known. However, it can be
                  expected that whatever initial technology makes it to the
                  consumer market will almost certainly not be cheap. Though, as
                  with all technology, this will decrease with time. While our
                  stated ideal involves a projection easily run by museum staff,
                  outside contractors may be considered on a temporary basis to
                  mitigate the costs of the machine and computer modeling for
                  what is likely to be a trial run of such events.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The proposed benefits to interpretation and the understanding
                  of visitors may well outweigh the costs and challenges
                  volumetric holograms bring with them. Museums are no stranger
                  to these kinds of calculations, and the emergence of a new
                  technology should excite as much interest as it does wariness.
                  These issues are delicate, but not insurmountable, and the
                  resulting creation has the potential to add an unmatched new
                  tool to assist our storytelling.
                </p>
                <h2>Where we go From Here</h2>
                <p>
                  Technology is never stagnant. People look at what they have
                  and use on a day-to-day basis, and dream of something better.
                  Creative endeavors like <em>Star Wars</em> show us a future
                  which, while fraught with war and struggle, is filled with
                  technology that we can only imagine. And then, we try to make
                  it a reality. We start experimenting, and wondering if we
                  really could have what we saw on the screen: a cell phone, an
                  intelligent robot, or even a hologram. Incremental
                  improvements are made, refined, and released as each moves us
                  one step closer to the machinery we imagine. Volumetric
                  holograms have captured the collective human imagination, and
                  designers, programmers, and artists are racing to catch up.
                  Their utilization in the museum, at least in their ideal form,
                  poses many potential benefits. This is especially true in
                  large scale landscape interpretation which at present is so
                  limited by the risks and costs associated with reconstruction,
                  but is so critical for the interpretation of context of a now
                  ruined structure or estate. Despite their likely costs, the
                  elimination of reliance on the imagination of a visitor may
                  allow for more accurate interpretation and information to be
                  imparted by the museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  No interpretation method can be completely perfect, but the
                  possibilities which volumetric holograms provide may allow for
                  a new horizon for museums to utilize. In the next few decades,
                  we could see slave quarters projected atop their foundations
                  showing the spread of an estate far past the main house. We
                  could see the engineering feats of indigenous groups like the
                  Hopewell recreated to tower over us. We may see Roman ruins
                  and temples, once lost to the impacts of time, restored to
                  completeness, if only for a moment. Maybe, in the corner,
                  we’ll add a small Carrie Fisher, pleading for the fate of the
                  galaxy, just to remind us how far we’ve come.

Both are out of sight of the audience. There is a sheer film suspended between the stage and the audience, which is capturing the reflection of the actor dressed as a ghost beneath the stage. Because of the viewing angle, it appears to the theater audience that this reflection stands onstage with the visible actor, creating a ghost." class="q-figure__image" src="/Museum-Digital-Practice-2023/_assets/images/figures/fig-bolesta-02.jpg">
