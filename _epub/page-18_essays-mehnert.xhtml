                    The Holocaust is the history of great tragedy and trauma. The
                    Holocaust claimed the lives of over six million European Jews
                    and over five million non-Jewish people.

                    industrialized the killing of those they considered a threat.
                    The main focus of their destruction were the Jewish people of
                    Germany and the countries that they conquered. As the war was
                    concluding the Allied forces came across the concentration
                    camps where much of the industrialized killing took place.
                    Though the Nazis tried to disguise the purpose of such camps
                    and their deeds, the survivors found clinging to life in the
                    camps were clear evidence of what the Nazis tried to hide.

                    After the end of World War II, the documentation of the extent
                    of the Nazi’s atrocities began. While in the final stages of
                    the war Nazi soldiers attempted to destroy the evidence of
                    what had occurred, there was much documentation of the
                    Holocaust remaining for the Allies to discover. Documentation
                    and the physical sites were important in discovering the scale
                    and inner workings of the Final Solution, however, the
                    survivors themselves were a key resource to understanding the
                    horrors that were inflicted. Many of the survivors have spent
                    a great deal of their time after the Holocaust detailing what
                    exactly happened to them during the war. Whether through
                    written means, a journal, or an article, or through talks that
                    they give to those willing to listen. The documentation given
                    by the survivors is an extremely powerful tool to combat the
                    ever-growing denial of the Holocaust. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 1</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Holocaust

                    Despite the large volume of evidence, both physical and oral,
                    denial of the Holocaust has existed since the beginning stages
                    of the discovery. At first it was the Nazis attempting to save
                    themselves from the punishments for the atrocities they had
                    committed. However, even so many decades past the event, there
                    are a great deal more deniers than ever. Widespread
                    disinformation has been disseminated by the internet,
                    contributing to the growing problem. Much of this denial
                    centers around discrediting the survivors and witnesses. Those
                    who deny the Holocaust tend to downplay what happened and
                    minimize what losses happened if they do say that any happened
                    at all. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 1</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Holocaust

                    disinformation. Organizations like the

                    strongest tools to push back against the deniers is the voices
                    and stories of the survivors.

                    Ever since the end of the war many organizations have created
                    ways to record the stories of those who witnessed the events
                    that took place. With the improvements in technology, digital
                    recordings have provided a way to preserve the voices and
                    faces of those telling the harrowing stories of survival and
                    pain. With the numbers of survivors ever dwindling, these
                    recordings are extremely important to preserve the words and
                    emotions felt by the survivors. Recording the stories has
                    enabled a great deal of information to be kept safe from the
                    decay of memory and the destruction of physical evidence.

                  <p>
                    While the written word is powerful, an oral history recording
                    helps to preserve the emotions in the voice and the face of
                    the speaker. These emotions help evoke empathy and sympathy
                    from the viewer in a stronger way than the written word.

                      memory of those who suffered; and to encourage its visitors

                    This mission statement declares the museum’s intention to
                    educate their visitors of the history of the Holocaust and how
                    the echoes continue to affect the world today. Through their
                    programing at the museum and their online resources the USHMM
                    does a great deal to preserve and circulate the information
                    that exists detailing the Holocaust.

                    The USHMM spends a great deal of effort to record the stories
                    of survivors and use these testimonies to educate the public.
                    They have a very large archive that can be accessed in person
                    through a request on their website.

                    the Holocaust and those who did and did not survive it. They
                    also have a great deal of objects that can help tell the story
                    of the Holocaust. Many of the documentary and video-based
                    evidence is digitized. Their website has a page dedicated to
                    connecting viewers to different types of records to give
                    different perspectives and information. These include written
                    documentation and recorded videos of survivor’s testimony. As
                    well as the online archive on their website, the USHMM also
                    has a YouTube channel where they share videos, lectures, and
                    eye-witness accounts.

                  <h2>The YouTube Channel</h2>
                  <p>
                    The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s YouTube channel
                    was started in 2006, with their first video being in 2007.
                    (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Wong 2011, 104</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Wong, Amelia S. “Ethical Issues of Social Media in

                    useful tool for many years. From the beginning the videos had
                    a strong focus on communicating the oral stories of those who
                    survived. Starting in 2013 videos (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdiuTwfJZzc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdiuTwfJZzc</a>) on the USHMM’s YouTube channel started to make use of
                    livestream technology to broadcast interviews and talks to a
                    wider audience than those who were able to make the lecture in
                    person. Today the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
                    maintains a strong presence on YouTube, posting some form of
                    content around twice a month. While survivor stories are
                    featured heavily, the YouTube channel does feature objects
                    from their collection, historian talks, stories of other
                    genocides, and many other types of videos. The large range of
                    content on their channel follows the USHMM’s mission to
                    “advance and disseminate knowledge.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">USHMM 3</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. “Mission and

                    platform, a place that is easily found through internet
                    searches on the topic of the Holocaust, the United States
                    Holocaust Memorial Museum is able to reach out to a wider
                    audience than if they had kept all of their videos solely on
                    their website.

                  <p>
                    YouTube as a platform has multiple advantages making it a good
                    place for the USHMM to share and store videos on. By using
                    YouTube as a host, the USHMM is not bearing the burden of
                    storage for these videos. YouTube itself is an incredibly
                    successful and popular video sharing website so using it as a
                    platform can help increase engagement.

                    of the comment section of the USHMM’s videos much easier as
                    the platform’s policies now fully support such actions.

                    Institutions dealing with such heavy topics such as the
                    Holocaust, especially when the truth of the events are
                    directly under attack, need to curate their digital media
                    carefully. The decision on whether to allow dialogue in
                    comments under the videos is an important idea. Dialogue is a
                    good way to encourage public engagement with the content
                    produced, however, dialogue can bring in people acting in bad
                    faith. If only positive comments are allowed, this can be seen
                    as censorship of certain viewpoints. While perusing the
                    comments on the YouTube channel of the United States Holocaust
                    Memorial Museum I only saw positive comments, whether this is
                    due to their curation of the comment section or to the fact
                    that only those who are interested in the topic for positive
                    education are seeking out this information is unknown.
                    According to Amelia Wong, who had moderated the comments for
                    the USHMM’s YouTube channel, a set of criteria was developed
                    to prevent abuse, denial, and hate from spreading through the
                    comments on their videos. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Wong 2011, 104</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Wong, Amelia S. “Ethical Issues of Social Media in

                    before the changes of YouTube’s terms of service in 2019, so
                    it is unclear what exactly the affect of the changes have been
                    to the channel in general, but the current state of the
                    comments shows that a similar trend of keeping up the
                    positivity is continuing.

                    Since the conflict between Israel and Palestine broke out in
                    late 2023 all of their latest videos have had the comments
                    turned off. This could have been a preemptive attempt to avoid
                    conflict in the comments, or a response to comments that were
                    made as the conflict began in earnest. Either way, clearly the
                    moderators of the YouTube channel have had to adjust their
                    strategy based on the current events happening in Israel.
                    While silencing the ability for discussion is something that
                    Wong had written was not something that the USHMM was
                    interested in, clearly the conflict has created a need for
                    extra protections and safeguards for the channel’s health.

                    A newer part of the USHMM’s channel is the inclusion of
                    shorts. YouTube Shorts are videos that are of 60 seconds or
                    less duration. Shorts are YouTube’s attempt to find the
                    popularity of Vine or TikTok with the short video format.
                    Often these short video formats are used to grab the attention
                    for a brief period before moving on to the next video. While
                    shorts are an interesting approach to appealing to the
                    attention span of the current generation, some might think
                    that they are lacking the context needed to fully understand
                    the story. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Pagenstecher 2018, 117</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Pagenstecher, Cord. “Testimonies in Digital Environments:

                    to be generally less meaningful and less engaging than what
                    the subject matter seems to dictate. The USHMM has used the
                    format of the Short in a couple different ways, some of which
                    seem to fit the tone of the rest of the channel, while one
                    series of three videos does not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Majority of the shorts on the channel are the videos in the
                    series “Truth Is…”. These shorts focus on the physical
                    evidence left behind by the Holocaust. In the 60 second videos
                    an object is presented by the survivor that it is attached to.
                    The survivor describes the object and how it shows the truth
                    of their story. The objects range from a photograph of their
                    family to a doll, to an ID card. The wide range of objects,
                    from innocent to sinister show the true scope of how people
                    were affected by the Holocaust and the memories that were
                    tainted by it. There are a couple of videos that tell the
                    stories of victims and survivors but without narration,
                    relying solely on text to give context to the images shown.
                    Overall, these fit the general theme of the rest of the
                    YouTube channel, using the survivors’ stories to explore the
                    truth in the history of the Holocaust.

                    There are three shorts that drastically deviate from the rest

                    answering two questions that were posed in the comments of the
                    first short. This type of question-and-answer video is fairly
                    common in the short form video format. However, to me this
                    format feels very lighthearted and lacking the gravity that
                    the rest of the channel provides. The two questions that Mr.
                    Jampoler answered,

                    drastic difference in the tone and style of the video was
                    quite jarring. The short format of the video did not allow for
                    Mr. Jampoler to elaborate on his answers, nor even to finish
                    his thoughts as the first of the two answers was cut off due
                    to the short format.

                  <p>
                    While a question-and-answer format would be a good way to
                    continue to educate the audience of the YouTube channel, using
                    the Shorts question and answer format would be a mistake. With
                    the live technology that the USHMM has been using for many
                    years already, a question-and-answer livestream would allow
                    for a more natural flow and for the answers to be complete and
                    fully fleshed out. Overall, the Shorts format does not fully
                    remove the context as some might worry it would, but only if
                    the videos are very carefully crafted. The biggest problem
                    would be the fact that these shorts can be mixed into the
                    algorithm and be shown in the middle of inappropriate videos
                    given the content and theme of the USHMM’s Shorts.

                  <p>
                    As time moves forward the available living memory of the
                    Holocaust shrinks. Survivors die out and their voices and
                    testimonies are lost. We find ourselves further and further
                    removed from the horrors of the Holocaust. As the twenty-first
                    century proceeds, humanity finds itself facing one crisis
                    after another. This constant flood of trauma and pain through
                    the media has desensitized the general populace to such
                    horrors. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Clark 2005, 266</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Clark, Mary Marshall. “Holocaust Video Testimony, Oral

                    Social media platforms operate based on continuous bombardment
                    of information and media that has led to mental fatigue and
                    lack of attention span in its users. This lack of attention
                    can lead to issues with the proper contextualization of the
                    trauma and the pain that the videos of the USHMM are trying to
                    convey. While the visual imagery of the survivor telling their
                    story is powerful, the indifference of a modern or future
                    viewer may render all of the effort pointless.

                    With modern pain dulling the shock of the past, how can
                    institutions like the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
                    keep modern audiences engaged with their message? Their
                    YouTube series
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWQC3P4psZP4_DifJjcRahhzYwXkKCV29" target="_blank">Eyewitness to History</a>
                    is a treasured archive of the testimonies of the survivors of
                    the Holocaust. The engagement with the videos is often
                    positive, however the previous curation of the comment section
                    and the current disabling of comments, makes it difficult to
                    know what exactly the engagement of the channel is. With the
                    current conflict in Palestine causing a great deal of
                    attention to be drawn to the subject of the Holocaust, there
                    is as great a need as ever for channels like the USHMM to
                    continue producing content that can get through the mental
                    fatigue and grab the attention of those searching for
                    information. By using YouTube Shorts, the USHMM has a chance
                    to take advantage of the short form media to transmit small
                    snippets of information to an audience that may not have been
                    seeking out information directly like with their other videos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With evolving media technologies and strategies, the USHMM
                    seems primed to continue using social media and digital
                    content to spread awareness and education. With continued use
                    of their digital collections and carefully curated content,
                    there is a great deal of possibility in their YouTube channel.
                    The use of Shorts may assist in their ability to reach a
                    previously untapped audience, as the YouTube algorithm works
                    its magic. As long as the social media curators continue to
                    respect the tone and themes that they are bound by, there is a
                    lot that can be achieved by their current model.
