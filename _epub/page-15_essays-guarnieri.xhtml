                    is a virtual museum dedicated to preserving, documenting, and
                    sharing the history of girlhood and female empowerment. Unlike
                    other museums, Girl Museum doesn’t have a physical building
                    that people can visit. Instead, the museum has a website with
                    virtual exhibitions that people can interact and engage with
                    online. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Impact 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Impact”. <em>Girl Museum</em>

                    virtual exhibition is, how the staff at Girl Museum curate
                    their exhibtions, and the future of Girl Museum. To provide
                    more in-depth information on Girl Museum and how the staff
                    curate their virtual exhibitions, I have included summaries
                    and video clips from two interviews that I conducted with the
                    Founder and Head Girl Ashley E. Remer and the Education
                    Advisor Hillary Rose at Girl Museum.

                  <h2>What is Girl Museum?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Girl Museum is a virtual arts and social history museum that
                    is run entirely by volunteers. Unlike a traditional museum,
                    Girl Museum has no stanchions or offices, no personal
                    collection, and no paid staff. The museum was founded by Head
                    Girl Ashley E. Remer, a current PhD student at Australian
                    National University in Art History. The museum is also
                    overseen by a Board of Directors, an Advisory board of
                    scholars, and a senior staff of long-term volunteers dedicated
                    to specific programs and projects including Education Advisor
                    Hillary Rose. The museum also has a team of Junior Girls,
                    which includes interns and younger volunteers. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Impact 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Impact”. <em>Girl Museum</em>
                        <a href="https://www.girlmuseum.org/about/impact/" target="_blank">https://www.girlmuseum.org/about/impact/</a></span></cite>) A year into the museum’s creation, Remer quickly realized
                    that she needed to hire interns to help with the overwhelming
                    amount of work that she had to create the museum. The
                    overwhelming number of responses from women in a variety of
                    fields across the world exceeded Remer’s expectations. In
                    2010, Remer assembled a team of seven interns from around the
                    world, which became the first cohort of Junior Girls. The
                    interns helped create exhibitions, write for the blog, apply
                    for grants, and explore other resources and projects for the
                    museum. Many of those interns became long term volunteers and
                    are still on the staff today. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Remer 2010</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ashley Remer, “Girl Museum: a Global Project, Girlhood

                        140-148.</span></cite>) This is a testament to the incredible dedication and
                    passion that is coming out of Girl Museum.

                  <h2>The Girl Museum</h2>
                  <p>
                    The Girl Museum has
                    <a href="https://www.girlmuseum.org/view/exhibitions/" target="_blank">39 virtual exhibits</a>, a podcast called
                    <a href="https://www.girlmuseum.org/view/projects/" target="_blank">GirlSpeak</a>, a blog, and many other resources for its visitors. The
                    GirlSpeak podcast is currently on hold, but past episodes can
                    be found on their website as well as Spotify and Apple
                    Podcasts. Girl Museum also has an Instagram, Facebook, YouTube
                    channel, and a Twitter page where they are able to market
                    their virtual exhibits, podcast episodes, and share additional
                    content on the history of girls and girlhood. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Impact 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Impact”. <em>Girl Museum</em>
                        <a href="https://www.girlmuseum.org/about/impact/" target="_blank">https://www.girlmuseum.org/about/impact/</a></span></cite>) In the past the museum had also created a few online
                    exhibits on Tumblr, but they are no longer on the site. The
                    main focus of Girl Museum are their virtual exhibits that are
                    broken into four sections, Girlhood in Art, Art of Girlhood,
                    Girls in the World, and Contemporary Art. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Exhibitions 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Exhibitions.” <em>Girl Museum</em>, July 3, 2022.
                        <a href="https://www.girlmuseum.org/view/exhibitions/." target="_blank">https://www.girlmuseum.org/view/exhibitions/.</a>"</span></cite>) Unlike museums that highlight the digitized objects from
                    their personal collection or others within the same
                    institution (ie. Smithsonian museums sharing objects with each
                    other), Girl Museum uses copyright-free and open access
                    digitized objects from other museum collections in their
                    virtual exhibits. In displaying the objects in their exhibits,
                    Girl Museum highlights art, history and cultural institutions
                    from around the world. One challenge in this model, however,
                    is that some museums have begun to copyright their digitized
                    objects, forcing the museum to pay to use them. Girl Museum
                    has limited funds and cannot always afford to pay for those
                    copyrights. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Remer 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Remer, Ashley. Recorded interview via Zoom with author,

                  <h2>What are Virtual Exhibitions?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Virtual exhibits, also referred to as digital exhibits, are an
                    ensemble of interlinks curated in a section of a museum’s
                    website that has the objective to disseminate digital
                    multimedia content to deliver innovative presentations of a
                    concept or movement. Virtual exhibits are similar to physical
                    exhibits in that curators have to think constructively about
                    the theme or concept that will help to tie the objects
                    together. The main objective of exhibitions is to provide a
                    space for the presentation of artifacts, art pieces, and other
                    objects that serve as a center of knowledge specialized in a
                    thematic area.

                    Implementing a virtual exhibit doesn’t simply mean publishing
                    images of cultural objects in a gallery, it involves creating
                    an interesting software product that supports the visitor’s
                    experience. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ciurea and Filip 2019</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ciurea, Cristian, and Florin Gheorghe Filip. “Virtual

                    feel as if a museum was virtually stepping into a museum. The
                    homepage had white stone columns on either side similar to
                    those founded on the front of many museum buildings around the
                    world. Each virtual exhibit had a separate background color
                    and font that would make it feel as if visitors were entering
                    different rooms of a museum. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Remer 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Remer, Ashley. Recorded interview via Zoom with author,
                        October 20, 2023.</span></cite>) Early scholars in the field argued that the 2D interface
                    leaves little to no room for an immersive experience, whereas
                    a 3D virtual recreation of a physical exhibition or museum
                    allows visitors to navigate the virtual scenario in a way that
                    is closer to the reality of walking through the physical
                    building. Unfortunately, the software tools associated with
                    creating the 3D model of virtual exhibitions are not always
                    accessible to museum staff as they require sophisticated and
                    expensive equipment. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ciurea and Filip 2019</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ciurea, Cristian, and Florin Gheorghe Filip. “Virtual

                    create a virtual museum that resembled a physical museum,
                    Remer states that she found the initial website for the museum
                    to be too busy and overwhelming for visitors. Over the years,
                    she has found that their current style, though simple, is the
                    most accessible, sustainable, and effective way to entice and
                    engage visitors in the museum’s many virtual exhibits.

                  <h2>How Girl Museum Curates Their Virtual Exhibits</h2>
                  <p>
                    Curating a virtual exhibit at Girl Museum begins with a
                    meeting between Remer, Rose, and the curators where they
                    discuss what the exhibit is going to be about, what will be
                    featured at the exhibit, and how long the exhibit will take to
                    create from start to finish. According to both Remer and Rose,
                    exhibits normally take anywhere from 1-3 years to complete,
                    but the museum’s staff can be flexible with that timeline to
                    take advantage of opportunities that come up quickly. After
                    the initial meeting, a Google doc is created where those who
                    are working on the exhibit are able to put digitized photos of
                    the objects that will be featured in the exhibit, research
                    done on the topic of the exhibit, and other important
                    information relevant to the exhibit. This Google doc allows
                    the volunteers to gather information for the exhibit on their
                    own schedule without having to deal with multiple meetings,
                    especially since the volunteers are located around the world.
                    The team of volunteers that are working on the exhibit, along
                    with Remer, will then begin to draw an outline as to what the
                    exhibit is going to look like on the website. The information
                    is then brought to the Program Manager Tiffany R. Isselhardt
                    who inputs the exhibitions onto the website, which is located
                    on Wordpress. The team then checks the exhibit for any
                    spelling and grammar mistakes before it is posted to the
                    public. Right before the exhibit goes live, Rose and a few
                    other volunteers will then begin to create an Educational
                    Guide PDF for the exhibit that teachers and parents can use
                    with young children to help them further engage with the
                    information and topics explored in the exhibit. Rose and Remer
                    are always seeking to find new ways to use the online space to
                    the fullest to provide many resources for girls around the
                    world. For instance, many of the Girl Speak podcast episodes
                    are attached to the virtual exhibits along with videos and
                    other sources of media that help to make the exhibits more
                    engaging and interactive to visitors.

                    <a href="https://www.girlmuseum.org/project/defining-our-terms/" target="_blank"><em>Defining Our Terms</em></a>
                    is a virtual exhibit that provides an overview to the history
                    of girls and girlhood. This exhibit is Remer’s personal
                    favorite and one that she advises many first-time visitors
                    take a look at to gain a better understanding as to the type
                    of work that the museum is hopping to do with their other
                    virtual exhibits. The exhibit is broken down into four
                    sections Girlhood in Art, Art of Girlhood, Girls in the World,
                    and then lastly GirlSpeak. The exhibit tackles a variety of
                    issues concerning young girls throughout the world and
                    highlights important young girls in history including Anne
                    Frank. There is an education guide at the bottom of the
                    exhibit that encourages visitors to answer questions about the
                    exhibit, analysis the images that are found throughout the
                    exhibit and activities that young girls can do to help them
                    further engage with the information provided in the exhibit.

                    instead provides visitors with a lot of in-depth information
                    on a variety of topics. The long forum of in-depth information
                    present in <em>Defining Our Terms</em> is not something that
                    can always occur in physical museums, due to a lack of space.

                    is one of Rose’s favorite exhibits that she has taken part in
                    creating at the museum as it explores fifty-two objects that
                    represent girls and girlhood from many different cultures
                    located around the world. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Rose 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Rose, Hillary. Recorded interview via Zoom with author,

                    each week. The exhibit has an interactive map from Google maps
                    that pins each object in the exhibition to its country of
                    origin. Each object is also featured on the main page of the

                    be sent to a blog post that provides more in-depth information
                    on the object and its culture of origin. The blog posts were

                    interactive element to the exhibit and the blog posts allow
                    for more long forum descriptions that provide in-depth

                    provides visitors with more information than they would

                    an exhibition that enhances the visitor experience for those

                    am wanting to learn more about them.

                    Other ways that Girl Museum uses the online space more fully
                    in their other virtual exhibitions is by providing links to
                    organizations that greatly impact girls around the world,
                    youtube videos and other sources of multimedia content that
                    help to provide more context and infromation to the topic of
                    the exhibit, and posting comments made by young girls and
                    women around the world on what a girl means to them.

                    exhibition that takes full advantage of the limitless space
                    that the internet has to offer for museums. Despite not
                    feeling as if visitors are clicking through virtual reality
                    versions of physical exhibits. Girl Museum has continued to
                    find ways to make their 2D interface as interactive and
                    engaging as possible to visitors. This has resulted in Girl
                    Museum creating virtual exhibitions that many other museums
                    could use as a blueprint when curating their virtual/digital
                    exhibitions.

                    Accessibility to another essential characteristic of virtual
                    exhibits. This became essential during the Covid-19 pandemic
                    when many museums closed their doors to the public after
                    people were told to stay at home and socially distance in
                    order to help slow down the virus. Virtual museums allow for
                    visitors from the local community and around the world to
                    visit and interact with objects without the limitations of
                    time or location. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it became
                    increasingly clear to museums that they should have
                    digital/virtual exhibits that go along with their physical
                    exhibits.

                    Another challenge for Girl Museum is that it is illegal for
                    anyone to track the data of children under eighteen years old.
                    Unfortunately, Girl Museum’s target audience is children
                    between twelve- and eighteen-year-old girls. The museum has
                    begun to roll out a survey to teachers that would hopefully
                    help to gage how teachers have found the museum’s exhibitions
                    helpful in the classroom. With the help of Google analytics,
                    the Museum is able to track their visitors who are above the
                    age of eighteen years old. According to their 2022 Yearly
                    Report, Girl Museum brought in about 172,210 visitors, their
                    high-test attendance yet, with 187 new community members and
                    produced 3 new exhibitions. About 60 percent of the visitors
                    identified as female, with about 32% being between ages 18-24,
                    with most of their visitors coming from the United States,
                    United Kingdom, and India. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Impact 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Impact”. <em>Girl Museum</em>

                    target audience, this data still highlights that the virtual
                    exhibitions are receiving positive feedback from visitors.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Looking into the Future:</h2>
                  <p>
                    Despite their decision to produce exhibitions that use the 2D
                    presentation model, the staff at Girl Museum, have been
                    interested in curating an exhibit that would be a 3D virtual
                    reality simulation of a physical exhibit. The exhibit would
                    have walls and digitized replications of art pieces and other
                    objects that visitors could virtually walk through using a VR
                    headset or click through with their mouse. The museum was in
                    contact with a few people at a major software company to make
                    a prototype of a virtual reality exhibit that Girl Museum
                    would later be able to put on their website. After a few
                    emails, the staff at the major software company decided to not
                    purse the project further. Due to a lack of funding, they
                    aren’t able to curate a 3D virtual reality simulation of a
                    physical exhibit on their own to post to the website without
                    having a team of volunteers that would be able to produce the
                    project. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Remer 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Remer, Ashley. Recorded interview via Zoom with author,

                    anything by not producing 3D virtual reality exhibitions.
                    However, Remer and the rest of the staff at Girl Museum are
                    always looking for ways to expand their resources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Girl Museum has recently released an exhibit titled
                    <em>Sitting Still</em> that include 45 paintings, miniatures,
                    prints, and watercolors from public and private collections
                    around the world that are from the 15th century through to the
                    mid 20th century of girls sitting. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Exhibitions 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Exhibitions.” <em>Girl Museum</em>, July 3, 2022.

                    production mode and will be released in 2024 and 2025.
                    Currently, the staff at Girl Museum are also reflecting on all
                    their exhibits, the podcast, the blog, and the other resources
                    that are on the website to see how they can better serve their
                    visitors. In the future, Remer and the staff would like to
                    produce documentaries, short films, classes, an online
                    database on girlhood, and many other resources aside from the
                    virtual exhibits. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Remer 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Remer, Ashley. Recorded interview via Zoom with author,

                        October 20, 2023.</span></cite>) Even though the virtual exhibits are a big focus of the
                    museum, the staff are constantly coming up with new projects
                    that better serve girls around the world. Once the staff
                    curates a list of projects that they would like to create, the
                    staff will then begin to contact institutions and
                    organizations that the museum could potentially partner with
                    on these projects, along with writing grants that would help
                    them receive some additional funding to put into these
                    projects. In the future, Remer would also like to be able to
                    get a technology volunteer that would be willing to work on
                    figuring out more ways that the museum could help to make some
                    of these projects happen. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Remer 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Remer, Ashley. Recorded interview via Zoom with author,

                  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                  <p>
                    Girl Museum highlights the need for museums to focus more
                    attention on how they can better serve visitors online. When
                    it comes to producing digital/virtual exhibitions, museums
                    should explore how they could feature objects that are within
                    their collection, along with various sources of multi-media
                    content found online, to enhance the visitor experience. Even
                    though the staff at the museum has focused most of its
                    attention on curating informative and education virtual
                    exhibitions, the future of Girl Museum highlights the
                    limitless possibilities that museums have to curate helpful
                    resources for anyone located around the world to use. This
                    highlights the importance of online institutions like Girl
                    Museum as they are able to make information more accessible to
                    anyone around the world who may not be able to visit museums
                    physically in person. As a museum entirely volunteered based,
                    this also showcases how essential this passionate and
                    committed staff is to producing resources for girls around the
                    world.
