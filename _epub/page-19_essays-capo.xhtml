                    With the development of technology, the typical museum visit
                    has evolved. The inclusion of hands-on or immersive technology
                    into museums is more commonplace than ever. Especially after
                    the pandemic, museums are looking to maintain the visitor
                    numbers by creating unique and interesting experiences.
                    Meanwhile, game-based learning has been understood for decades
                    to be beneficial to learners in a multitude of settings.
                    Whether in the classroom or informal learning environments
                    like museums, adding games to enhance learning has shown to
                    increase interest and retention. With ever-improving
                    technology, video games have been more widely accepted as a
                    possible tool for education. Another way museums are looking
                    to attract more visitors is through partnerships with
                    recognizable video game and media brands. There are three
                    exhibits that are currently on view that are partnerships
                    between museums and recognizable franchises. The three
                    partnerships are with the established franchises of Roblox,
                    Pokémon, and Animal Crossing. The partnerships range in scope,
                    from special exhibits to experiences that span the whole
                    museum. They also range in output from programs that are
                    mostly promotional to more of a game-based learning model.

                    Despite the pervasive stigma that video games are only for
                    kids, the original audience for video games who grew up in the
                    80s and 90s are aging and now have kids of their own. Many of
                    the game franchises that are available now have been on the
                    market for multiple decades, with an enduring fan base. Museum
                    partnerships like those with Pokémon or games developed by
                    Nintendo, brands that have been popular for 30 years, have the
                    potential to bridge generations and create connections.
                    Connections that could add to a museum visit, if also well
                    designed and educational. With partnerships like that with
                    Roblox, the nostalgia factor is most likely not there, but
                    that does not limit the multigenerational potential of newer
                    games. If the game elements are intriguing enough, the whole
                    family can learn together, both the game and the educational
                    material.

                  <p>
                    Though video games are played by many ages, these three
                    franchises are very popular with younger demographics. This
                    brand recognition can attract families with children, and lead
                    to the exposure of museums and museum learning to younger
                    people. The learning potential of a museum when in conjunction
                    with the resources and technological infrastructure that the
                    game companies supply could be indicative of what could be
                    possible for the future of game-based museum learning to
                    enhance museum visitor experience.

                    retention of content. For decades, educational video games
                    have been an established sector of the industry. Gaining
                    popularity in the 1980s, educational video games contrasted
                    with the new violent games of the decade and in many ways
                    paved the way for the normalization of video games in the
                    mainstream. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Newman, 2017</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Newman, Michael Z. “Children of the '80s Never Fear:

                  <h2>Current Exhibitions</h2>
                  <h3><em>Roblox</em> at the Metropolitan Museum</h3>
                  <p>
                    In
                    <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/13745860159/The-Replica" target="_blank">collaboration with <em>Roblox</em></a>, the Met launched its own app, called <em>Replica</em> in
                    2023 (available
                    <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-met-replica/id6448757664?platform=iphone" target="_blank">on iOS</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.verizon.replica&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank">Android</a>). <em>Replica</em> uses augmented reality (AR) that takes
                    advantage of the programmable nature of <em>Roblox</em>,
                    encouraging players to “collect” art and objects at the Met.
                    The <em>Roblox</em> partnership is not tied to a specific
                    exhibit, but instead uses a select number of pieces throughout
                    the whole museum The player can walk around the museum with a
                    smart device and “scan” the available objects with the
                    device’s camera. To find the available objects, the app
                    includes a museum map and geolocation feature, which senses
                    when the player is close to an available object. Once in the
                    correct room, the app also provides written clues and a
                    silhouette to help the player find the specific object. These
                    scavenger hunt-like features encourage discovery and
                    close-looking at the objects in the galleries. With some of
                    the pieces, such as the armor, the players can transfer them
                    to their <em>Roblox</em> account, enabling their virtual
                    avatar to wear the objects from the museum, creating an
                    interactive element beyond the trip to the museum.

                    The “sandbox” nature of <em>Roblox</em> has allowed for many
                    educational possibilities including those currently available
                    for the Metropolitan Museum in New York. <em>Roblox</em> is
                    one of the newer games to reach mass popularity status. Much
                    like the also massively popular game, <em>Minecraft</em>,
                    <em>Roblox</em> is a very flexible “sandbox” or open world
                    game. A sandbox game is one where players are able to build
                    their own experiences through programming. Despite being
                    developed decades ago, it only gained popularity in the late
                    2010’s especially with the under 12 demographic. Additionally,
                    <em>Roblox</em> exploded in popularity during the Covid-19
                    pandemic due to the ability to interact virtually with
                    friends. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Liao, 2020</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Liao, Shannon. “How Roblox became the ‘it’ game for

                    the social component can lend themselves very well to the

                    As a partnership, the one with the Met is successful as well
                    as it integrates the best parts of both parties. Replica
                    allows for the exploration of the Met’s enormous collection as
                    well as displays the versatility of Roblox as a game. The game
                    elements included in the Replica app achieve the self-directed

                    The players are able to wander the museum at their own

                    included in the game. Also maintaining the element of
                    engagement as there is a set number of objects to collect and
                    the added benefit of having the objects be digitally
                    functional after their visit to the Met. The player is
                    motivated to collect as many museum objects as they can. The
                    adaptability and graceful failure are maintained as well, but
                    more subtly. The silhouette and clues for the objects can
                    apply to multiple pieces, and because the Met’s collection is
                    so large and diverse, one set of armor, for example, might be
                    confused with another.

                    that centers around a fictional universe where characters
                    catch, train and battle powerful creatures called Pokémon. The
                    franchise includes digital media such movies, tv shows, and
                    video games as well as physical media including books, manga
                    and comics. The most well-known physical media created by the
                    franchise are the collectible <em>Pokémon</em> cards that can
                    be traded and played with.

                    In its 30-year history, <em>Pokémon</em> became a behemoth of
                    a media franchise. The Japanese company as a whole is the
                    largest media company in the world, and its video game sector
                    alone is in the top 5 in the video game industry.

                    started in the 1990s and has managed to maintain its cultural
                    relevance. The youngest target audience for
                    <em>Pokémon</em> is in the 8-12 year old range. However due to
                    its long staying power, the earliest fans are well into their
                    adulthood, and might want to share their love of the franchise
                    with their children.

                  <p>
                    The exhibit, titled, “<a href="https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/van-gogh-museum-x-pokemon" target="_blank"><em>Pokémon</em> at Van Gogh Museum</a>,” opened in September 2023, and runs until January 2024.
                    Though not an obvious pairing off the bat, it is meant to
                    reflect the appreciation that Van Gogh had for Japanese art
                    during his lifetime. The special exhibit includes six works of
                    art, where <em>Pokémon</em> are included in paintings inspired
                    by Van Gogh’s more notable works. There are two activities in
                    the exhibit. One includes instructions on how to draw Pikachu,
                    the most identifiable character in the franchise. The other
                    involves details and facts about Van Gogh’s life and his
                    relationship with Japanese art as described in a letter he
                    wrote to his brother. Additionally, there is a limited time
                    <em>Pokémon</em> card of Pikachu in the style of a Van Gogh
                    self-portrait sold in the museum’s gift shop. Since the
                    opening of the exhibit, the card was so popular that it sold
                    out quickly. The museum had to subsequently cancel the restock
                    due to “safety concerns” because the museum shop was being
                    mobbed by “alleged scalpers”. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Wong, 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Wong, Vicky. 2023. “Van Gogh Museum pulls Pokémon card

                    ability to bring people to the museum shows the power that
                    these partnerships can have for museum attendance.

                    At the time of writing, the exhibit is still ongoing, and
                    therefore, the results are still to be determined. However,
                    there is lost opportunity in the offerings of the partnership.
                    The two activities and the limited-edition card, though
                    interesting, could have been more interactive or immersive
                    using an existing <em>Pokémon</em> video game. In 2016,
                    <em>Pokémon</em> developed the massively popular
                    <em>Pokémon GO</em>, an AR game that was accessible on
                    smartphones. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Isaac, 2016</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Isaac, Mike. “Pokémon Go Brings Augmented Reality to a

                    player to capture and train Pokémon with AR. Additionally,
                    there is precedent for a potential addition to the partnership
                    with the Van Gogh Museum. Following the games meteoric rise in
                    popularity, museums included <em>Pokémon GO</em> in their
                    programming and saw a huge increase in their visitation.

                    Though not necessarily a video game centered exhibit,
                    <em>Pokémon GO</em> could have been an interesting addition to
                    the Van Gogh Museum’s educational content. The addition of
                    <em>Pokémon Go</em> would fit the game-based learning elements
                    motivation and engagement. The game is structured around
                    progressing through physical space to attain a goal in
                    conjunction with the location-based technology, it could have
                    leveled up the interaction with the educational content of the
                    cultural and history of the museum. The infrastructure of the
                    AR from <em>Pokémon GO</em> would be an interesting addition
                    for purely educational content. The opportunities with AR to
                    aid in immersive educational experiences are still being
                    explored, including currently at the Metropolitan Museum in

                  <h3><em>Animal Crossing</em> at the Seattle Aquarium</h3>
                  <p>
                    Another example similar to that of <em>Pokémon</em> at Van
                    Gogh is
                    <a href="https://www.seattleaquarium.org/events/animal-crossing-x-seattle-aquarium/" target="_blank"><em>Animal Crossing</em> at the Seattle Aquarium</a>. <em>Animal Crossing</em> is a game series developed by
                    Nintendo. They are life and social simulation games, where
                    players take on the role of a character who moves to a virtual
                    village or island populated by anthropomorphic animals. The
                    aim of the game is for the player to develop and beautify
                    their own village or island by growing fruit and vegetables
                    and to develop friendships with the non-player characters. The
                    most recent <em>Animal Crossing</em> game,
                    <em>New Horizons</em>, came out in March of 2020. With
                    everyone scared and stuck at home during the COVID 19
                    pandemic, <em>Animal Crossing</em> became very popular as a
                    relaxing escape for players. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">MacDonald, 2020</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">MacDonald, Keza. 2020. “‘It’s uniting people’: why 11

                    that the game runs in real-time; the in-game time and seasons
                    mirror those of the real world. Seasonal events, and different
                    fish and insects become available at different times of the
                    day and year, encouraging players to visit regularly and
                    experience the game’s changing world. Interestingly, there is
                    a museum in the game where the players can collect and donate
                    fish, insects, fossils and art to put on display. All the
                    donated specimens and objects are based on real-world ones,
                    and when donated, the in-game curator, an owl named Blathers,
                    will share facts about the donation.

                    The partnership with the Seattle Aquarium runs from October
                    2023-January 2024 and includes photo opportunities with
                    standees of the notable characters, animal facts that are the
                    same as the ones for the in-game museum, and a “bingo
                    scavenger hunt” that visitors can play on a smart device.

                    that are in the game as well as in a selected tank at the
                    aquarium. The scavenger hunt is a good addition to the
                    offerings, allowing for a collaborative element with kids and
                    their grown-ups. There is a potential for the programming to
                    evolve, as the aquarium does promise more activities as it
                    continues.

                    Much like the partnership with <em>Pokémon</em> and Van Gogh,
                    The Seattle Aquarium’s partnership with
                    <em>Animal Crossing</em> is mainly promotional –– to either
                    get fans of the game interested in the aquarium or fans of the
                    aquarium interested in the game. Also like with the
                    partnership with <em>Pokémon</em> and the Van Gogh Museum,
                    there are some lost opportunities.
                    <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizon</em> uses game-based learning
                    strategies in its motivation and engagement as it is a
                    progression of tasks toward a larger goal, while continually
                    learning about the animals that the player catches or objects
                    they collect. The game also uses some elements of adaptivity
                    and graceful failing, as bugs and fish can escape from the
                    player. These game-based learning strategies from the video
                    game would benefit the collaboration. The age range for
                    players in 3-years-old and up, which might account for the
                    simplistic offerings of the partnership. There was the
                    potential to add more content to what was already available in
                    the game. Perhaps even add some virtual or interactive
                    elements for other immersive experiences that might mimic the
                    game play and the game-based learning.
                  </p>
                  <h2>What Can We Learn?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Video games of any kind are a difficult product to produce.
                    Especially with any specificity of subject matter that also
                    meets the standards for successful game-based learning. For
                    both the museum and game-companies, creating a game for a
                    specific location or exhibit is expensive, and takes specific
                    technological understanding. Some museums have made their own
                    video games that engage players either virtually or in the
                    museum’s physical space. For example, the Centre Pompidou in
                    Paris launched their own video game, <em>Prisme 7</em>, in
                    2020. Expanding the definition of museum beyond that of
                    physical space is one of the ways that museums can stay
                    relevant in an increasingly technological world. With the
                    financial and technological help of a recognizable game
                    franchise, there is the possibility of more advanced
                    technologies to be included in museum game-based learning
                    events and exhibits in the future like augmented reality (AR)
                    and virtual reality (VR), or artificial intelligence (AI).
                    These technological advancements might be difficult for
                    museums to achieve by themselves, due to tight budgets and
                    finite resources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the visitor, a main limitation is that of accessibility.
                    For many of these partnerships, a device is required in order
                    to engage. This can create a barrier for those museum visitors
                    without access to a smart device, or without the ability to
                    lend one to their children. This excludes lower income
                    visitors, and visitors who are not tech-savvy. These
                    limitations are hard and expensive to overcome, as they do
                    require the museum or game company to provide some sort of
                    interactive technology. There also are drawbacks to immersive
                    technology-based experiences in museums. The increased foot
                    traffic of people who are immersed in their screens rather
                    than the objects in front of them can be a detractor to the
                    experience for people who prefer to enjoy a museum in a
                    traditional way. For families specifically, with an
                    increasingly virtual world, limiting their children’s screen
                    time might also be a priority, and therefore might want to
                    avoid exhibits and museum programs that center around more
                    screens.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                  <p>
                    The educational possibilities for game-based learning in
                    museums is ever evolving, especially with the addition of ever
                    evolving technology. Current partnerships with museums and
                    large video game franchises are utilizing those possibilities
                    to varying degrees of success. <em>Roblox</em> and the Met’s
                    development of <em>Replica</em> is a successful case of
                    utilizing game-based learning factors of motivation,
                    engagement, alterability and graceful failure.
                    <em>Pokémon</em> and <em>Animal Crossing</em> had the
                    potential to be educationally engaging as well as promotional.
                    The hope of including game-based learning where a game is
                    integrated into a place of learning, not quite fulfilled with
                    the examples at the Van Gogh Museum and Seattle Aquarium.
                    These two examples and the inclusion of game brand-specific
                    content in the museum could be the first step toward their
                    further integration of major popular media into the museum
                    landscape. However, these kinds of partnerships are also a
                    possible step toward future collaborations where technology
                    and education can create a unique and engaging experience for
                    the visitor.
