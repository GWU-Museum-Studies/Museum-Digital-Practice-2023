                    The use of barcodes to catalog and inventory collections is a
                    well-established practice in the museum field. The use of QR
                    codes in exhibits to deliver content is likewise a
                    well-established museum practice. The COVID-19 pandemic
                    allowed the numerous uses and capabilities of QR codes to
                    become fully and broadly realized. This research will examine
                    different type of barcodes, the use of QR codes in museum
                    exhibits, and the use of both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional
                    barcodes in museum collections. Additionally, this research
                    seeks to examine how a shift in museum collections from
                    1-dimensional barcodes to 2-dimensional barcodes could further
                    promote accessibility and efficiency of collections
                    management.

                    Before getting into the use of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional
                    barcodes in both museum exhibitions and collections, we first
                    must define these terms. A barcode is a one-dimensional
                    machine-readable representation of data that encodes
                    information into bars and alphanumeric characters.

                    spacings, and size. This numeric digit code can be scanned
                    with a coherent laser beam, and the reflected light is decoded
                    by the scanner. The deciphered code is then input into a
                    system and calls up information about the object to which the
                    barcode is attached. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Manning 1999</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Manning, William Albert. “Automated Systems in Museums:

                    numeric digit code, inputs the UPC (Universal Product Code)
                    number into the register, and charges you the appropriate

                    A QR code (Quick Response code) is a two-dimensional
                    machine-readable barcode. A QR code is composed of a series of
                    black and white modules, which represent a bit of embedded
                    data, that run both horizontally and vertically (two
                    dimensional) (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Scandit 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">“Types of Barcodes: Choosing the Right Barcode.” Scandit,

These bits of embedded data can be decoded with a scanner,
                    including most smartphones. QR codes have seen major growth
                    over the past 3 years, especially as a result of the COVID-19
                    pandemic. Museums and other sectors saw a need to minimize
                    high-touch areas, such as restaurant menus and museum signage,
                    to mitigate the further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The
                    capability of QR codes to connect offline media with online
                    content was an appealing solution to this problem emerging
                    worldwide.

                    Even as we shift into a “post-pandemic world”, many businesses
                    and institutions still prefer the QR systems implemented
                    during the pandemic. In 2022, it is estimated that 83.4
                    million smartphone users in the United States scanned a QR
                    code, compared to the estimated 65.7 million in 2020.

                    advantage of 2-dimensional barcodes is error-protection
                    formulas, which keeps the data intact and the barcodes
                    scannable even after being damaged.

                  <h2>QR codes in exhibits</h2>
                  <p>
                    QR codes have been used in museum exhibits for years prior to
                    the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first way museum
                    exhibits have used QR codes is to provide additional
                    information about an exhibit and/or artifact. There are many
                    reasons why certain information would be included in a QR code
                    and not on display text. The first reason is simply aesthetic
                    reasons: too much text on a label is distracting and
                    overwhelming. The second reason is because of the nature of
                    some material, whether audio, digital, or another format,
                    which may be more effectively displayed digitally. The Hammer
                    Museum in Los Angeles has implemented additive QR codes in
                    many exhibits, such as the <em>Witch Hunt</em> exhibition, in
                    which QR codes can be scanned for curator commentary videos,
                    and the <em>Made in L.A.</em> exhibit, in which a QR code for
                    “Angel’s Fruits” by Mario Ayala can be scanned and will
                    redirect the user to a YouTube playlist.

                  <p>
                    Additionally, QR codes can provide a greater understanding of
                    artist intent and creation process through multimedia content
                    from the artist. In the
                    <em>The Land Carries Our Ancestors: Contemporary Art by Native
                      Americans</em>
                    exhibit at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.,
                    sign postings (Figure 1) throughout the exhibit redirect
                    museum patrons to audio tracks in which the artists discuss
                    their work and their personal connection to the land. Use of
                    QR codes in this way can transcend the limitations of
                    traditional wall text and provide visitors with deeper
                    understanding of the objects they are interacting with. Beyond
                    appreciation for the objects and/or artwork itself, QR codes
                    can foster a greater connection and appreciation for the
                    artist, their process, and their community.

                    Another common use for QR codes in museum exhibition is to
                    facilitate self-guided, audio, and multi-lingual tours. This
                    wall text (Figure 2) in the

                    section text and wall label text in Filipino, ‘Ōlelo Hawai’i,
                    and CHamoru. Multi-lingual tours encourage guests from around
                    the world to fully engage with the exhibit. Virtual tours can
                    also further accessibility for guests who may be visually
                    impaired, hard of hearing, or neurodivergent.

                    QR codes can also serve as additives to an exhibit through
                    digital assets and collections. Directing patrons to digitized
                    objects allows the experience of getting up close and personal
                    with the object without the conservation and safety concerns.
                    The <em>Galloway Hoard Exhibition</em> was a traveling exhibit
                    of Viking-age objects found in Britain or Ireland. The
                    National Museum of Scotland held this exhibit in the summer of
                    2021 and developed QR codes for the exhibit, which re-directed
                    users to interactive 3D models and photographs of the exhibit
                    objects. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Coulson 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Coulson , Adam. “QR Codes in Museums - Worth the Effort?”

                    the QR codes to determine which digital assets were most
                    popular, and visitor flow through the exhibit. This bird pin
                    was the most scanned 3D object in the exhibit. The Galloway
                    Hoard Exhibition demonstrates how QR codes can foster
                    interdisciplinary collaboration, in this case exhibits and
                    collections, and provide a deeper experience of the
                    institution as a whole to patrons.

                  <p>
                    However, there are some downfalls to QR codes that are out of
                    the museum’s control. Not every patron will scan all the QR
                    codes, some may not scan a single one. Using analytic data,
                    the National Museum of Scotland states that 65k people visited
                    the <em>Galloway Hoard Exhibition</em> and the QR codes were
                    scanned 26k times. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Coulson 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Coulson , Adam. “QR Codes in Museums - Worth the Effort?”

                    This means that anyone with an updated Apple or Android
                    smartphone could scan QR codes without needing to download a
                    separate app, which was required to read QR codes on most
                    smartphones before 2017. However, not everyone who walks
                    through an exhibit will have access to a capable smartphone.
                    This requires museums to carefully consider which information
                    is essential a patron’s experience and understanding of an
                    exhibit. Museums must strive to enrich the experiences of both
                    the QR-scanning patrons and the non-scanning patrons alike.

                    The major pitfall of the use of QR codes in exhibits is
                    complete dependency on them over traditional wall text and
                    object labels. In her article for the Los Angeles Times, “The
                    Curse of QR Codes in Museums,” Carolina Miranda describes the
                    oversaturation of QR codes in some museum exhibits. The author
                    recounts a personal visit to the Los Angeles County Museum of
                    Art’s

                    exhibit, in which the only wall text in the exhibit was an
                    opening statement and any information about the artist,
                    object, or region had to be accessed via QR code.

                    guests, both disabled and able-bodied, a total dependency on
                    them can also alienate museum guests from connecting with the
                    material and stories being displayed.

                    Through years of implementation across thousands of
                    institutions, the value and shortcomings of QR codes in museum
                    exhibits are becoming fully realized. The important take away
                    is that QR codes can offer exciting opportunities for museum
                    patrons to interact with the exhibits but should not be
                    completely relied on to deliver information. Rather, QR codes
                    should be used in combination with traditional wall text and
                    object labels to foster truer and deeper connections with the
                    objects. The utility of QR codes in exhibits has been
                    demonstrated time and time again, and 2-dimensional barcodes
                    are starting to demonstrate their utility in museum
                    collections as well.

                    Museums across the world have been utilizing barcodes to label
                    and track their collections decades prior to the QR code
                    “boom” of the 2020s. Scanning the barcode will enter the
                    object’s ID number into the Collections Management System
                    (CMS) and pull up the object record. Based on different
                    institution’s documentation procedures, this record may
                    include photos, donor information, accession records, or past
                    condition reports. While they do not replace traditional
                    artifact labeling, barcodes can enhance the speed, accuracy,
                    security, and cost-effectiveness of recording museum objects.
                    Barcodes can be especially useful when conducting an inventory
                    or moving a collection. Barcodes also remove the margin for
                    human error when entering data; it is estimated that the error
                    rate of barcodes is 1 in 36 trillion.

                    require an up-charge. One of the main challenges of
                    1-dimensional barcodes in the museum collections context is
                    the monetary and technology investment required to generate,
                    print, and scan barcodes. The 1-dimensional barcode’s
                    necessary equipment and lack of online capability does not
                    promote growth and access outside of the museum collection.

                    So, why are Collections Managers so attached to traditional
                    barcodes? It is an established system within many
                    institutions, and many may already have the necessary
                    equipment and software. More so, it is a system which has
                    proven its utility. However, 2 dimensional barcodes in museum
                    collections may boast the same advantages as 1-dimensional
                    barcodes with new opportunities, such as connection to online
                    content and greater access without a specialized barcode
                    scanner.

                    For many institutions, QR codes are addressing the
                    shortcomings of 1-dimensional barcodes. While barcodes require
                    software to create, printers, and barcode readers, QR codes
                    can be created very easily and freely online. I created the
                    below QR code (Figure 3) which links to the GWU Museum Studies
                    program webpage for free and in under 60 seconds. Likewise, I
                    used my personal cellphone to scan it. A barcoding project
                    with 2-dimensional barcodes may not require software or
                    scanner, but still requires investment in a barcode label
                    printer.

                    Traditional barcodes can only deliver numeric data, while QR
                    codes can deliver numeric and alphanumeric data. This means QR
                    codes can be used in the same data entry/lookup capacity as
                    1-dimensional barcodes while also being able to link to online
                    resources and multimedia content. Other features that may make
                    QR codes favorable for use in museum collections include high

                    The National Museum of Mongolia undertook a barcoding project
                    in 2016 with funding from the American Center for Mongolian
                    Studies and the United States Embassy in Mongolia.

                    Barcoding the collections reduced the time it took for
                    inventory projects from 2-3 years to 4-6 months. The barcode
                    used in this project was a 2-dimensional barcode, such as a QR
                    code, but utilized only to deliver numeric data. This barcode
                    was affixed to a label, which was tied to the object, along
                    with its unique identifying number and name of object. When
                    scanned, the object’s unique identifying number is entered
                    into the museum’s software “Register,” and pulls up the object
                    record, which includes location, origin, material, and storage
                    condition. This project greatly increased the efficiency,
                    access, and organization of the institution’s collection. The
                    National Museum of Mongolia did not utilize the online
                    capabilities of the 2-dimensional barcodes because of the
                    project scope and resources. This project exemplifies the
                    broad usability of 2-dimensional barcodes, which functioned to
                    deliver numeric data like its 1-dimensional counterparts, but
                    still boasting the advantages of 2-dimensional barcodes, such
                    as high-speed scanning.

                    If something’s not broken, why fix it? When you can make it
                    even better than before! Utilizing barcodes to catalog and
                    inventory collections is old news in the museum world.
                    Collections professionals around the world recognize and
                    demonstrate the benefits of barcoding collections, such as
                    reducing human error when entering data and increasing
                    efficiency during inventory projects. As QR codes have
                    populated the exhibit walls of our museums, collections
                    professionals have begun to deliberate if two-dimensional
                    barcodes may be better suited to their institutions and
                    collections management. A shift from 1-dimensional barcodes to
                    2-dimensional barcodes will not increase the efficiency of
                    cataloging or conducting inventory. Rather, it is a more
                    cost-effective option for these projects, eliminating the need
                    for specialized barcode scanners and barcode translators. In
                    many ways, QR codes are metaphorically bringing collections
                    objects out of storage. Shown through the Galloway Hoard
                    Exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland and the
                    barcoding project at The Museums of History NSW’s Vaucluse
                    House, QR code technology is allowing museum guests to engage
                    with collection items in new and exciting ways.

                    Integrating QR code technology from museum exhibits into
                    collections will promote greater accessibility of collection
                    items for research and curiosity alike. Implementation of
                    2-dimensional barcodes accessible to the public will further
                    promote transparency and accountability of what museums hold
                    in their collections. Utilizing QR code technology in
                    collections will further foster the relationship between an
                    institution and the public it serves. The efficiency of
                    traditional 1-dimensional barcodes has been demonstrated by
                    numerous institutions. While effectively expediting inventory
                    processes, these barcodes have not done much else outside of
                    collections. Bringing QR codes and other 2-dimensional
                    barcodes into museum collections will likewise expedite
                    catalog and inventory projects, while also allowing the
                    artifacts and stories to reach newer and broader audiences.
