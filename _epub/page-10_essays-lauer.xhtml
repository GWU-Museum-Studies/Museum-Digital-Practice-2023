                    Imagine you show up to a museum where you are unable to read
                    any of the information, to listen to the docents and guides,
                    or even determine where the bathrooms are located. Maybe it’s
                    a museum in a foreign country. Maybe it’s the museum in your
                    own neighborhood. Either way, that museum is inaccessible to
                    you. Now imagine that in the palm of your hand is a device
                    that can help you read, listen, and find what you are looking
                    for through instant translation of text and speech. While this
                    kind of device is still limited to sci-fi novels and movies,
                    this ability could soon be available to us as machine
                    translation continues to be perfected. As the technology
                    stands now, there are still limitations to what machine
                    translators are able to do, but they can be a helpful tool for
                    museums to use to help expand their community outreach and
                    better serve their multilingual visitors when used in
                    conjunction with human translators.

                  <p>
                    According to US Census Bureau data from 2018-2019, nearly 68
                    million in the United States people speak a language other
                    than English (LOTE) at home. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">US Census 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">U.S. Census Bureau. “Nearly 68 Million People Spoke a

                    1980, it is clear that non-native English speakers are a
                    growing part of the American population. In some states, 1 in
                    3 people speak a LOTE at home.

                    includes over 2 million households, around a third of the LOTE

                    English “less than very well.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">US Census 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">U.S. Census Bureau. “Nearly 68 Million People Spoke a

                    the opportunity to target these members of their communities.
                    By creating materials in other languages, people may feel more
                    accepted and welcome in a museum. They will also likely be
                    able to learn more about the museum and its collections than
                    if they walked around an exhibit with text in a language they
                    do not speak and be able to ask questions and engage.

                    Many different forms of communication exist within museums
                    that would necessitate translation within a multilingual
                    museum. In her
                    <em>Survey of Translation Practices in Museums,</em> the
                    Manager of Interpretive Media and Resources for the National
                    Gallery of Art, Reema Ghazi found that about half the 26
                    surveyed museums regularly translated wall text, labels, maps,
                    interpretive brochures, and resources for families.

                    rarely translated. This is likely because interactive and
                    audio resources are typically more expensive to translate than
                    simple text labels. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Kushner Bishop 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Kushner Bishop, Jill. “Engaging Multilingual Audiences

                    is used in a variety of museums, the small sample size of 26
                    museums included in Ghazi’s survey makes it difficult to
                    determine if this is representative of the field at large. A
                    larger sample size in different types of museums would give
                    stronger evidence of the field as a whole.

                    were surveyed were offering most visitor information in more
                    than one language. While the survey is outdated in 2023, it
                    does give some insight to the reasons for early adopters of
                    translation in museums. Over half of the U.S. museums surveyed
                    in 2009 said that the most common reason for multilingual
                    offerings was an institutional mandate to make exhibits and
                    programs accessible to a range of audiences.

                  <h3>The Limitations of Human Translation</h3>
                  <p>
                    Museums often face the challenge of limited resources.
                    Translation services can be prohibitively costly. While the
                    cost can vary, professional translation services for
                    translating the wall text for an exhibit into one other
                    language can cost thousands to tens of thousands of dollars.
                    (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ghazi 2022, 506</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ghazi, Reema. “Translation Practices in Museums: What the

                    including the number of words to be translated, the language
                    that it is being translated to, the content type, turnaround
                    time, and the expertise of the translators.

                        <a href="https://eriksen.com/faqs/" target="_blank">https://eriksen.com/faqs/</a>.</span></cite>) Generally, a professional translator costs around $0.10 to
                    $0.30 per word, so a single label with 150 words would cost
                    between $15 and $45. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Bagińska 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Justyna Bagińska, “How Much Does It Cost to Hire a

                    Beyond the price of the translation itself, there are other
                    costs associated with translated text. Languages take up
                    different amounts of space on a wall or page even when they
                    are direct translations. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ghazi 2022, 506</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ghazi, Reema. “Translation Practices in Museums: What the

                    In order to cut down on the cost of translation, museums may
                    apply for grants or raise money, but often they rely heavily
                    on bilingual staff to perform translation services. Ghazi’s
                    survey determined that about 75% of museums handled their
                    translation internally by staff, volunteers, or board members.

                    translators and interpreters adhere to ethical guidelines for
                    the field of interpretation, such as confidentiality and

                    are not likely to receive any training or evaluation of their
                    translation skills before being used to translate materials.
                    This puts undue burden on the bilingual staff to perform
                    beyond the scope of their knowledge and expertise. They may
                    feel pressured to do the translations on behalf of their own
                    communities even though those communities would best be served
                    by professional translators.

                    Humans also have limitations in their knowledge of different
                    languages. There are certainly some polyglots who know more
                    than a couple of languages, but no one can store the hundreds
                    of different languages that exist in our world. Each time a
                    museum wants to offer their content in additional languages,
                    they have to find a new translator which will double the costs
                    discussed above. To offer live programs like tours, museums
                    may have to hire another staff member who is able to speak
                    that language. These human resource costs add to the overall
                    difficulties of a museum to provide interpreted information to
                    their visitors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Human translation of written text also requires another
                    limited resource in museums, time. Generally, a translator
                    works on about 2000-2500 words per day. That is equivalent to
                    about 15 labels of 150 words. In a large exhibit, it could
                    take weeks to get all of the text translated. Because the
                    wording of labels may be edited multiple times throughout
                    development of an exhibit or program, that means that the
                    translator will need to return to edit sections they already
                    completed. If there are last minute edits to the original
                    text, those changes need to be reflected in the translation
                    and this could lead to delays in production if the translator
                    is not given enough time to complete the changes and lead to a
                    lesser quality of translation.

                    increase the cost of the overall project.

                    With the limitations of human translators and the strain that
                    translation can put on resources, finding solutions to these
                    problems is imperative for museums to be able to offer
                    materials and programs in multiple languages. Translation
                    technology has existed for decades and continues to improve.
                    It may offer a solution to many of the obstacles that prevent
                    museums from presenting information in multiple languages to
                    their guests.

                  <p>
                    While ideas of how to easily translate between two languages
                    had existed for a long time, the first use of machine
                    translation can be dated back to 1933 when French scientist
                    George Artsrouni patented his idea for a mechanical
                    translation device which he called the “mechanical brain.”

                    tape that was meant to help retrieve stored information
                    quickly. One application that he pictured was producing
                    word-for-word translations. He first successfully demonstrated
                    the device in 1937. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Akbari 2014</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Akbari, Alireza. “An Overall Perspective of Machine

                  <p>
                    World War II spurred on translation technology research by the
                    military and by the 1950s, multiple universities had begun
                    research on mechanical translation including Massachusetts
                    Institute of Technology (MIT), University of Washington
                    Seattle, and University of California Los Angeles. MIT hosted
                    the first conference on machine translation in 1952. The field
                    continued to grow slowly from there over the next few decades
                    as it was difficult and costly to research. In the late 1980s,
                    IBM researchers published an article about statistical
                    approaches that led to increasing the power of computers and
                    the capacity of their memory as well as decreasing costs. This
                    helped researchers develop a new “example based” approach to
                    translation. This new statistical technique “translates the
                    phrase and words based on earlier translated texts.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Sreelekha 2016, 234-235</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Sreelekha, S. “A Survey Report on Evolution of Machine

                    the 1980s. Today, many of the most common machine translation
                    tools–including the most popular tool Google Translate (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Elliot 2022</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Elliott, Christopher. “The Best Translation Apps and

                    translation (NMT). NMT has faster, more accurate translations
                    than the previous types of machine translations. Rather than
                    translating a word or phrase individually, NMT produces
                    translations of whole sentences by pulling from data sets and
                    language modeling to better understand the context of the
                    whole text. This creates a more human-like quality to the
                    translations.

                  <h3>Machine Translation, a Fix?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Machine translation tools are able to address some of the
                    biggest limitations of human translators. For museums that
                    have limited budgets or resources, machine translators are a
                    cost saving measure. There are many free text machine
                    translators such as the most popular one, Google Translate.
                    Machine Translators can translate into hundreds of different
                    languages and dialects, so museums are able to provide
                    materials in many languages without raising the cost of
                    translation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Machine translation tools are also much quicker than human
                    translators. Machine translation only takes a matter of
                    seconds rather than days or weeks. Machine translation tools
                    are available all day, every day which allows for last minute
                    changes to be made to the text in exhibits or promotional
                    materials without a delay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With all of the benefits of machine translation, it would seem
                    to be the ideal tool for museums, but one of the biggest
                    limitations of machine translation is accuracy. While NMT has
                    greatly improved the quality of translation compared with
                    previous translation tools, it still does not provide the same
                    understanding of language as a human translator.

                    In addition to its inaccuracy, machine translation is only as
                    good as the data it was trained on. NMT falls victim to a
                    problem with many forms of artificial intelligence with
                    limited data sets: bias. Nearly 30% of text on the internet is
                    in English, so the tools have plenty of material to pull from
                    for English translations. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Che Wai Peh 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Che Wei Peh, Clara. “Is AI Generating an ‘Averaged’,

                    for machines to be able to pull from which can make the
                    translations even more inaccurate. The translations may even
                    be inappropriate or offensive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These two issues balance out the benefits of machine
                    translation. An inaccurate translation can have detrimental
                    results. Without someone who speaks the target language to
                    review the translations, museums risk insulting their visitors
                    and making them feel unwelcome or unwanted which goes against
                    the goals of introducing translated materials. However, this
                    does not mean that machine translation should be totally
                    eliminated. Museums can hire human translation editors to
                    review the machine translated materials for less than the cost
                    of a full translation which would help to address the major
                    concerns of NMT. Another form of machine translation that is
                    gaining popularity is computer-aided translation (CAT). CAT is
                    a type of software that reduces the work of human translators.
                    They include different tools that speed up the process like
                    translation memory. Essentially translation memory pulls from
                    the work that a human translator has already completed. Say a
                    sentence or phrase is used multiple times in a project, the
                    computer will save the translation and apply it to the later
                    uses in the project. With time saved by the translator, money
                    and resources are also saved by the museum. The discount can
                    range from around 5% to 25% depending on the company and the
                    repetitions used in the project.

                    solution, but it can help to reduce the overall costs for
                    museums.

                  <h3>Beyond Text in Museums</h3>
                  <p>
                    While this paper has focused so far primarily on text
                    translations because these are the most common forms of
                    translations in museum, I want to address machine voice
                    translation in live educational programs because this is a
                    developing area for museums.

                    LOTE-speaking visitors in the United States. If they want to
                    be able to ask questions and engage with museum staff or take
                    a live tour with a docent, they need to be able to listen and
                    speak the language of the staff member or the staff member
                    needs to speak the visitor’s language. For live programs,
                    there are a number of emerging devices that promise
                    simultaneous translation.

                    museum has invested in them, they do not have to pay the cost
                    of hiring additional multilingual staff. In theory, any staff
                    member can use the devices to speak to guests in a variety of
                    languages.

                    The Tenement Museum in New York is currently utilizing the
                    Ambassador Interpreter from Waverly Labs for this purpose.
                    Their website describes the machine as “wearable, over-the-ear
                    interpreter device that captures speech and provides both an
                    audio translation and a written transcription in real time.”
                    Visitors who wish to use the device can either borrow a
                    Tenement Museum tablet and earpiece or download the Ambassador
                    mobile app to use their own phones to connect via Bluetooth to
                    the earpiece used by the educator. The device is able to
                    interpret into 20 languages and 42 dialects.

                    Unfortunately, the device does not seem to live up to all that
                    is promised. According to reviews on the App Store, the
                    translations are not entirely accurate and the differences in
                    the dialects are negligible.

                    enunciation for accurate translations which creates a stunted,
                    unnatural speech pattern. The devices are only able to be used
                    in a visitor’s right ear and cannot comfortably be used on the
                    left which could be a problem for visitors with limited
                    hearing in one ear.

                    The United States Capitol in Washington, DC is providing tours
                    in Spanish and Mandarin using a Travis the Translator device.
                    The Capitol offers the language tours once a day in the
                    morning. The Capitol Visitor Center’s website does not provide
                    as much information about their device as the Tenement Museum.
                    It only says that “guides lead the tour with a translation
                    device.”(<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">US Capitol 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. “Foreign Language Tours.”

                    about the tours in English, Spanish, and Mandarin while the
                    Tenement Museum only provides the information on their tours
                    on their website in English. Unlike the Ambassador, it does
                    not require a separate user device like a phone or tablet to
                    be usable. The device is able to be used on its own and can be
                    played out loud for visitors to listen or can be with the
                    microphone and assisted listening devices the Capitol uses for
                    its standard English tours. The device allows for translation
                    to and from both the language of the guide and the language of
                    the visitor, so visitors are able to ask questions while on
                    tour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In my experience as a tour guide at the Capitol Visitor
                    Center, the tours I have led at the Capitol have had many of
                    the same problems as the Tenement Museum. The Travis device is
                    unable to keep up with human speech in real time unless the
                    speaker uses short, simple sentences. The Travis device can
                    take a few seconds to load and produce the target language
                    which means the speaker must wait for the processing to
                    complete before being able to continue speaking. The
                    translations are not always accurate or lack nuance which
                    leads to confusion among visitors. For example, when speaking
                    about a statue of the Ponca leader Chief Standing Bear
                    recently, the device translated his name as “jefe oso de pie”
                    or “boss bear standing.” Visitors then asked where the bear
                    was held in the Capitol. I do not speak fluent Spanish and
                    have no knowledge of Mandarin, so I am unable to recognize
                    when the translations are not correct unless a visitor
                    communicated confusion. A Spanish speaking tour guide would
                    have been able to better explain that the phrase was his name
                    and title rather than referring to a literal bear.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Devices like the Ambassador Interpreter and Travis the
                    Translator rely on the same NMT systems as text translations,
                    so they are subject to the same problems and more.
                    Additionally, voice translation devices require speech
                    recognition and speech synthesis software to work. This leads
                    to more systems that can produce errors. For example, the
                    Travis device registered me saying “that man” as “Batman” on
                    one of my tours and translated it as such. With text
                    translations, museums are able to edit materials before
                    presenting them to the public, but with live translations
                    there is no quality assurance testing. Until the technology
                    improves, hiring presenters who can speak the target language
                    still seems to be the best option for live programs.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                  <p>
                    Translation technology can address some of the issues that
                    acts as a barrier for museums, but the technology still needs
                    to improve before it can replace the human element that
                    language requires. The translation field continues to be
                    improved every day, so it may not be long until it is able to
                    equal human translations, but in the meantime, it can still be
                    used as a tool to assist people. Computer Assisted Translation
                    can help reduce the cost of text translations. Although voice
                    translation devices may not be ideal for translating entire
                    programs, they could be utilized for visitors to ask questions
                    as they navigate museums. Until the technology improves,
                    museums should continue to invest in making their content
                    accessible to all.
