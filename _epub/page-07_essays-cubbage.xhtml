                    Thanks to new technology and post-pandemic culture shifts in
                    the way we engage with spaces in person and online, the demand
                    for recreation of physical spaces on digital platforms for
                    education and recreation has never been higher. Advances in
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry" target="_blank">photogrammetry</a>
                    technology and VR integration have created new possibilities
                    for taking real objects and environments and recreating them
                    in explorable digital spaces. Potentially a result of the
                    COVID-19 pandemic, there is a strong desire for people to
                    experience meaningful places, which is evident in the travel
                    industry’s rebound as pandemic regulations lessened. People
                    desire to return to spaces that bring comfort and meaning, as
                    well as to experience things they could not during periods of
                    closure. Those who can’t travel find other ways to engage with
                    places they are nostalgic for, including through online
                    communities or through materials produced by museums and
                    historic sites. Audiences look for interesting ways to
                    experience meaningfully designed spaces as they remember them
                    through online formats, including through increasingly popular
                    theme park attraction ride-through videos,

                    cultural heritage.

                    An exploration of nostalgia and how it pertains to preserving
                    designed space inspired the following look at museums and
                    virtual reality. While considering the benefits of digitizing
                    existing exhibits for VR, I looked at the very active online
                    fan communities that exist around theme parks. Despite their
                    dedication being focused on for-profit parks and resorts,
                    theme park fans go to great lengths to record, document, and
                    digitize the histories of theme parks and attractions that
                    currently stand or that have long since been demolished or
                    modified. Rich, crowdsourced histories exist of Walt Disney
                    World rides from development to demolition. Extensive,
                    multi-POV ride through videos exist of attractions at parks
                    all around the world for those who may not have the chance to
                    visit them. Ambitious fans, such as those behind the
                    <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/8/22219427/disney-ride-20000-leagues-under-the-sea-watch-vr-defunctland" target="_blank">Defunctland VR Project</a>, have gone so far as to recreate entire ride experiences in
                    VR so that fans can experience lost attractions in full detail
                    once again. These projects are generated by themed
                    entertainment audience members who long to capture the work
                    that went into creating designed space and what it was like to
                    experience said attraction firsthand. These audiences aren’t
                    just a niche either—the
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVo63lbKHjC04KqYhwSZ_Pg" target="_blank">Defunctland YouTube channel</a>
                    regularly nets millions of views on their extensively
                    researched theme park history videos. Visitors feel a strong
                    sense of attachment to themed entertainment settings, often
                    strengthened by nostalgia for travel and for time spent with
                    family. I often see discussions online from fan communities
                    about theme parks, but rarely to the same degree about
                    museums.

                    While theme parks and museums might not immediately seem tied
                    closely together, they are both tourism destinations that are
                    designed to intentionally immerse visitors in an environment
                    where they are most receptive to the products or information
                    shared within them. The
                    <a href="https://www.teaconnect.org/" target="_blank">Themed Entertainment Association</a>
                    recognizes the close interconnectivity and shared audiences of
                    museums and theme parks for the tourism industry in the
                    experience economy. In both worlds, visitors’ complete
                    experiences are curated from entrance to exit to provide the
                    best possible visit. Both sectors strive to make the
                    experience of visiting memorable, unique, and distinct from
                    other places to foster a relationship with the guest. Exhibits
                    are designed to provide an environment that is complimentary
                    to the content—whether that is through immersive exhibits in
                    science museums or carefully curated spaces of reflection in
                    art museums. Museum objects do not exist out of place, the
                    space and presentation of how they are perceived are integral
                    to the creation of memory and the overall experience of the
                    visitor. Visitors will remember what’s meaningful because of
                    the wholistic experience, not just the objects themselves.

                    Theme park enthusiasts work hard to document park experiences
                    by sharing them while they are operational online for others
                    to see, or by painstakingly recreating demolished attractions
                    through photographs, video, and VR—largely because they know
                    the park ownership will not. Rebecca Williams’ work on fandom
                    culture around theme parks discusses that fan memorialization
                    of theme park attractions may help provide a method of
                    reassuring “ontological security” by allowing fans to
                    re-articulate and re-explore their attachments to rides and
                    exhibits and the associated memories tied to them. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Williams 2020, 213</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Williams, Rebecca.

                          participatory cultures</em>. Amsterdam University Press, 2020.</span></cite>) I believe that museum audiences are more like these theme
                    park enthusiasts than we typically discuss, but have a
                    different relationship of attachment to museums as sites to
                    preserve—the obligation to preserve museum spaces and their
                    history is not in the hands of fan-historians working against
                    corporate ownership but instead is a role for museums
                    themselves. Museums have a reputation of record keeping and
                    preservation, and there is an expectation of diligence in
                    documentation. When given ways to engage with museum exhibits
                    past and present online, I believe museum audiences similarly
                    re-explore their attachments in a way that fosters their
                    positive relationship with institutions. Virtual reality,
                    while primarily used for tours and outreach online for current
                    exhibits, allows museums to create records of their exhibits
                    that allow audiences to connect to their collections remotely
                    or after exhibits close. Maintaining the emotional connection
                    between visitors and exhibit spaces allows guests to explore
                    feelings of nostalgia and wonder linked to spatial memory,
                    helping encourage repeat visitorship, foster donor
                    relationships, and maintain positive feelings about the
                    institution.

                    Resources for creating Virtual Reality tours have become more
                    accessible, creating new possibilities for how exhibits are
                    documented and displayed online. Some museums, such as the
                    National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) are ahead of the
                    crowd with
                    <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/visit/virtual-tour" target="_blank">many virtual tours of exhibits past and present</a>
                    available on their website. Others have gone further and
                    created exhibit experiences in third party game software.
                    Still many other institutions have never considered creating
                    VR versions of their exhibits and would not know where to
                    begin. With the increasing pressure on museums to provide
                    online resources, I believe that utilizing VR to document
                    exhibits serves an important twofold function—it creates a
                    means by which audiences can engage with the museum from home
                    and it creates a record of the holistic experience of
                    exhibitions that can be used by museum fans and museum
                    academics when we discuss exhibit design.

                  <h3>Virtual Reality and Preserved Museum Spaces</h3>
                  <p>
                    The most widely used method of documenting real space in full
                    is using 360° cameras. Utilized in industries such as house
                    tours for real estate, mapping software, and in museums, 360°
                    cameras capture the panoramic details of a location through
                    photography. Typically done with omnidirectional cameras which
                    capture a picture in every direction at the same time,
                    panoramic images of spherical videos create a 3D effect
                    without being 3D. These pictures can be shared as 2D images
                    which can be navigated by scrolling or by following paths of
                    associated images that have been connected. Commonly used
                    services such as Google Photos and Facebook both have
                    integration for sharing these types of panoramic images. They
                    may also be captured for conversion for use in VR, which can
                    provide a more organic way for viewers to explore the space.

                    exhibits, although more expensive and therefore less often
                    utilized in smaller institutions.

                    The 2020 global pandemic acted as a catalyst for museums to
                    evaluate their digital footprint as the world adapted to
                    engaging with learning and culture through digital formats
                    during lock down and subsequent periods of high-risk
                    transmission. Museums who could not serve the public on-site
                    needed to find ways to engage their audiences through other
                    means, and more and more institutions took their first leap
                    into utilizing technology to provide some kind of supplemental
                    experience. While many museums opted to provide tours or
                    programs facilitated through video format over zoom or through
                    prerecorded tours, other museums with resources to do so chose
                    to innovate using XR technology (a catchall term for Virtual
                    Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality experiences).

                    provide additional interpretation to exhibits, sometimes
                    in-lieu of contact with educators. Other museums found ways to
                    present their collections of objects online, often in
                    blank-walled digital galleries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These digital galleries, albeit useful for the museum to share
                    their objects, may not integrate the thoughtful design of the
                    exhibitions that objects are presented within. While this may
                    work for certain types of collections such as art museums, it
                    fails to provide the immersion of experiencing an exhibit
                    in-context and does not create the nostalgic triggers
                    associated with seeing a work of art or exhibit in the context
                    of the museum space itself. This may lead to less association
                    between the viewer and the museum, as opposed to just the
                    object being presented. However, the blank-walled VR rooms
                    provide a fast way for museums to present art in explorable
                    space next to other associated works, likely saves work hours
                    and design costs to create, and do not require museums to
                    purchase cameras needed for fuller capture of the exhibit
                    environment.

                    This technology has been utilized by institutions such as the
                    Institute of Contemporary Art Boston, the MADC Museo de Arte y
                    Diseño in Costa Rica, the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit,
                    and the Wallace Collection in the United Kingdom. These VR
                    experiences allow museums to provide online experiences for
                    actively running exhibits, as well as preserve an online
                    archive of past exhibits. The digitization of the exhibit in
                    full context helps maintain the museum’s ownership of the
                    space and content in our associated memory. Vortic’s platform
                    also provides institutions the ability to host meetings,
                    tours, and events in their VR spaces, which helps transform
                    their VR exhibit environments from stagnant recreations of a
                    floor plan to settings that can be alive, discussed, and
                    experienced. Despite the convenience of Vortic’s services, the
                    potentially expensive per-month hosting and usage costs may
                    prevent smaller institutions from utilizing the platform for
                    their exhibits.

                    The VR format allows museums to preserve more than just the
                    spatial details of exhibits. As demonstrated thorough the Los
                    Angeles Museum of Art’s <em>Substrata</em>
                    <a href="https://epoch.gallery/substrata/" target="_blank">virtual exhibit hosted on the digital exhibition platform
                      EPOCH</a>, exhibits can integrate audio and ambiance into the
                    experience of viewing. Just as museums are not spaces void of
                    noise, music, and designed sound in person, digital exhibits
                    can also integrate audio into the experience. Not only does
                    this more closely mimic the experience a visitor might have
                    while viewing an exhibit and therefore more likely trigger
                    associated feelings of nostalgia, but it also offers a place
                    for the soundtracks designed for museum settings to continue
                    to live on past the exhibit’s in-person lifespan.
                    <em>Unsettled</em>, an exhibition created by the Australian
                    Museum, integrates audio that is key to the visitor experience
                    in-person into their
                    <a href="https://australian.museum/learn/first-nations/unsettled/" target="_blank">virtual tour</a>. In doing this, the virtual experience becomes closer to the
                    in-person experience and creates a space where the
                    compositions made for the exhibit continue to serve their
                    purpose.

                  <h3>VR Museums in Game Spaces</h3>
                  <p>
                    Recently, museums have begun to recognize the value of
                    partnering with video game companies to reach broader
                    audiences. Platforms such as Roblox, VR Chat, Second Life, and
                    Sansar provide existent platforms to host exhibits and
                    collaboration events within. This has certain benefits—these
                    platforms already have existing audiences that the museum can
                    draw from to expand viewership. They may already have
                    integrated creator tools and assets that make the process of
                    setting up the exhibit faster or more streamlined.
                    Partnerships with platforms benefit both parties and may help
                    cut costs of development or provide free advertising for the
                    partnering museum. However, it also has downsides. Although
                    true of most software that is not developed in-house, there is
                    no guarantee of the lifespan of the platform hosting the
                    virtual exhibit. Ownership of companies, hosting costs, and
                    collaborator interests all mean that there is no guarantee
                    that a digital exhibit created in these spaces will have
                    longevity. While innovative, game platforms can be a risky
                    place for museums to invest all their VR resources.

                    One example of this is the VR exhibit companion to the
                    Smithsonian American Art Museum’s (SAAM)

                    models and a total of 1,050 labor hours to create the VR ready
                    models. This exhibit provides immaculate renderings of the
                    artworks on display, as well as the associated lighting design
                    and sound that complimented them.

                    and utilize a VR headset to access, which creates a smaller
                    audience pool than if hosted on the SAAM site.

                    A successful integration of a museum in a game setting is the
                    digital version of

                      Second Life</a>. Over the pandemic, the Peale collaborated with Linden Labs,
                    the company behind both Second Life and Sansar, to recreate
                    the Peale and its exhibits on the platform. This undertaking
                    had twofold purposes—to allow visitors to continue to access
                    the Peale and its collections from home, as well as to allow
                    the staff and museum collaborators to meet in a setting that
                    allowed them to better activate their connection to the museum
                    while working remotely. This connectivity to the museum site
                    helped keep staff enthusiastic and connected to the collection
                    and helped them better understand their space so they could
                    develop projects even while away. The virtual Peale became
                    both a meeting space and an extension of Peale’s mission.

                    Hosting exhibits in game platforms allows virtual visitors
                    more expression, more movement, and often more detail.
                    However, the game element can also be a hindrance to the goal
                    of the content. Because it is hosted in Second Life, which

                  <h3>Archiving Designed Space For Museum Scholars</h3>
                  <p>
                    I believe there is value in documenting exhibit design for
                    educational and evaluative purposes for the museum field.
                    Operating with limited budgets, it’s understandable that
                    museums taking the effort to digitize exhibits for the sake of
                    the museum field can be seen as self-serving. But as a
                    graduate student, I have had many moments during research
                    where I desperately wished I could see exhibits that are no
                    longer standing to answer questions about how artifacts or
                    theming were presented in-context, how guests navigated spaces
                    and if they were accessible, or simply about how an exhibit on
                    a topic was handled by a museum. For academics who want to
                    innovate in the museum field, it feels remiss the
                    documentation of exhibits in-full is something that’s not more
                    widely done. Museum’s self-presented exhibit archives online
                    are often simple splash pages about what existed before--
                    occasionally, the more detailed include installation photos or
                    collection details. I am always thankful when a virtual tour
                    is available when researching museums, allowing me to compare
                    content even when I don’t have the privilege to see a site in
                    person.

                    A resource that made me consider the value documentation of
                    past exhibits is Zoolex. Created by the Zoo Design
                    Association,
                    <a href="https://zoolex.org/" target="_blank">Zoolex</a>
                    collects museum-submitted profiles about zoo and aquarium
                    habitats around the world. The database provides information
                    about zoo design, displays innovations in exhibit design
                    through photograph documentation and exhibit layout drawings,
                    and even provides climate data about the environmental
                    conditions of the habitat. Created as the result of Monika
                    Ebenhöh’s thesis “Improvements in Zoo Design by Internet-Based
                    Exchange of Expertise”, Zoolex acts as a resource for zoo
                    designers and caretakers. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ebenhöh 1992</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ebenhöh, Monika. “Improvements in Zoo Design by
                        Internet-Based Exchange of Expertise.” Masters diss.
                        University of Georgia, 1992.</span></cite>) I yearn for a similar multi-institutional database for
                    exhibit designers in the broader field. While Zoolex does not
                    provide fully digitized exhibit layouts, the photo
                    documentation alongside design information is an excellent for
                    visualizing space for those researching their exhibits. What
                    would a multi-institutional database for past exhibits look
                    like and could it be viable? That’s hard to say—the audience
                    could be niche, and like Zoolex, museums would need to opt
                    into summitting their own gallery tours or images. However, it
                    would be an amazing resource to have the ability to search
                    exhibitions up by topic to compare how they were handled at
                    institutions around the world and across time, allowing
                    designers to be inspired by what has come before, double check
                    their own work for accidental plagiarism from exhibits they
                    saw before but may have forgotten, and to compare how the same
                    topic might be exhibited to different audiences globally.

                    Some institutions like the National Museum of Natural History
                    have established digitization resources, such as the team they
                    dub the “Laser Cowboys”. The Laser Cowboys of the Smithsonian
                    Digitization Program Office’s 3D lab use laser scanners to
                    document exhibitions, such as the massive Fossil Hall before
                    it’s renovation in 2014. During that project, “cowboy” Adam
                    Metallo said: “The main purpose of 3D scanning an exhibit like
                    this is to have an archive of what an exhibit of this era
                    might have looked. This is a documentation for folks in the
                    future to know what a museum experience here was like.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Smithsonian Magazine 2013</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Smithsonian Magazine. “A Night at the Museum with the

                    objects for public access, but for documenting how the
                    exhibit’s design and context might be useful for designers and
                    academics in the future. While it can sometimes be hard to
                    justify the time and cost of digitization, the archival value
                    to the museum field is immense. It is my hope other museums
                    who have the resources to will also choose to document their
                    exhibits for this reason, especially ones that have such high
                    visitation or cultural impact such as NMNH.

                  <h3>Barriers to Creating VR Exhibits</h3>
                  <p>
                    While it would be amazing if every museum could digitize their
                    exhibits, the reality as discussed is that there are many
                    barriers to undertaking VR projects. While not every 3D
                    digitization project requires thousands of man-hours of work
                    to complete, they do all require some level of flexibility by
                    staff to take time, usually before or after operational hours,
                    to do the manual work of photographing or laser-scanning the
                    space. Most institutions do not have a team already trained in
                    photogrammetry technology, let alone in creating digital
                    programming, so time and financial resources are required to
                    train staff and purchase equipment or to hire external
                    contractors to complete the project. Even after the work of
                    scanning is completed, the institution then needs to host,
                    publish, or save the files for present or future use, which
                    requires the digital resources to do so. For institutions who
                    choose to partner with platforms like VR Chat or Second Life,
                    there must be staff available to manage the relationship with
                    the software and who can integrate the exhibit materials onto
                    the platform. These skills don’t come overnight, especially
                    for museums who have yet to adopt newer technologies. The
                    output of a virtual tour may require an entirely new staff
                    role (or more) just to get off the ground.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Outside of just the startup costs involved in taking on VR
                    projects, the longevity of VR exhibits once published is also
                    uncertain. Unless a museum has a robust team dedicated to
                    digital projects already, they are likely relying on outside
                    parties when hosting and creating their VR exhibits. Whether
                    this is through services such as Google, Second Life, or
                    Matterport, there needs to be somewhere to put the digitized
                    exhibit so that visitors can interface with it. While
                    companies expect their continued lifespans, the retirement of
                    the widely used Adobe Flash highlights that something that is
                    expected to be lasting and easy to integrate onto a web
                    platform isn’t necessarily going to stick around. Virtual
                    exhibits created on third-party platforms have an uncertain
                    fate if companies like Matterport or Vortic close. Could the
                    museum reuse the scans on another platform, especially if they
                    used proprietary scanning techniques during the image
                    collection process? Are there ways for the museum to keep
                    versions of the tours that don’t require any specific
                    software? These are questions to consider when we think about
                    the fate of digital exhibits that exist now. The National
                    Museum of Natural History supports the future of their digital
                    exhibit tours by working with virtual reality artist Loren
                    Ybarrondo, who coded their virtual tours in HTML5 and
                    JavaScript for specific use by the institution, meaning no
                    additional software is required to host. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Ybarrondo 2023</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Ybarrondo, Loren. “Loren Ybarrondo: Create Immersive

                    their VR projects, their budget allows for commissioned
                    coding. But other institutions may not have the same ownership
                    of their work and could grapple with hosting issues in the
                    future.

                    For smaller museums just trying to get a VR project off the
                    ground, uncertain hosting futures and usage rights can make
                    planning difficult. To help alleviate some of the resource
                    strain on museums starting up VR projects,
                    <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/egWRnanxkLB0zg" target="_blank">Google Arts &amp; Culture</a>
                    has initiatives and funding to provide different kinds of 3D
                    digitization services for free, and host VR tours of museums
                    and cultural sites on their platform. Partnering with Google
                    reduces the work on the museum teams themselves, but comes
                    with the complications of partnering with a massive company
                    that comes with its own corporate complications about access,
                    usage rights, user data, and funding that not every
                    institution is willing to sacrifice on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not every museum is likely to be sold on the pitch of 3D
                    digitization of exhibits. Some might value the temporal nature
                    of exhibitions and prefer to let them exist and then pass as
                    part of their process. Other museums may be protective of
                    their materials such as architectural details, lighting
                    design, or the artworks shown inside an exhibit. Some museums
                    may fear that a digital version of an exhibit will dissuade
                    in-person visitation. Artist’s usage rights might control the
                    digital use of their works, which may prevent inclusion in VR
                    exhibits. Anything from the unwillingness to use budget
                    resources to a distrust of digital platforms could act as a
                    barrier. For those who have already undertaken VR exhibit
                    efforts, there is also the possibility of discouragement – a
                    first VR exhibit experience might have been costly and time
                    consuming while learning the ropes, which may put teams off
                    from continuing to digitize more. Teams must grapple with
                    where to invest resources if VR exhibits aren’t getting the
                    outreach draw that were expected, even if the end product is
                    impressive and archivally useful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pitch to executives and donors to invest resources in
                    digitization can be difficult. Even the purest academic value
                    of preservation of exhibits for the museum field is unlikely
                    to be enough to sell VR exhibits to those who don’t see the
                    immediate value. But as discussed when considering audience
                    nostalgia of exhibits and attractions, there are ways to
                    articulate the value of digitized spaces that serve many
                    museum’s goals of legacy, audience retention, and outreach.
                    Pushing past the novelty of the medium can be difficult, but a
                    thoughtful argument can express how preserving exhibit spaces
                    benefit museum audiences past, present, and future. Museums
                    audiences are fan-bases, and just like nostalgic theme park
                    fans, they want to feel connected with places they associate
                    with recreation, learning, and family. Museums can take
                    ownership of their body of exhibition work and their own
                    nostalgic legacy by creating VR exhibits for their audiences
                    that help them remember, connect, and continue to learn even
                    long after an exhibit has been taken down. By doing so, they
                    can control their relationship to their audiences now, and to
                    audiences in the future looking back at what once was.
