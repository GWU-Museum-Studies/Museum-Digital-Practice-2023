                    More than simply buildings with exhibitions, museums seem to
                    have a specific cultural identity about them: marble columns,
                    grand atriums, security guards in every other room. But this
                    idea may not be entirely accurate anymore. As with nearly
                    everything in Western society, the internet has brought great
                    changes to the world of museums. Many major institutions have
                    at least partially digitized, publicly available collections;
                    museums have also adapted to innovations like social media to
                    further attendance. Alongside museums’ development in the
                    twenty-first century, video games have arisen as one of the
                    most popular art forms. Today, it seems impossible to walk
                    into a room of twelve-year-olds and not hear a mention of
                    Fortnite. Three games in particular–
                    <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em>,
                    <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em>, and <em>Dark Souls III</em>–
                    each show a potential example of video-game-as-museum. Through
                    video games, museums may well be able to find a path forward
                    in a rapidly changing, digitally-focused world.

                    First, however, it is important to define what a museum
                    actually is. This may seem simple at first, but it is a
                    deceptively difficult question. After all, what is it that
                    links a grand, national museum like the Smithsonians and a
                    tiny, one-room, community focused space like New York City’s
                    Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space? (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">MORUS</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">‘Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space.’ MORUS. Accessed

                    museums, at their core, serve as ritually and ceremonially
                    important spaces, residing in the same social space as
                    “churches, shrines, and… palaces.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Duncan Wallach 1980, 449</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Duncan, Carol, and Alan Wallach. 1980. “The Universal

                    museums when Duncan and Wallach were writing) serve to educate
                    the public, yes, but they also serve as concrete examples of
                    the state’s power.

                    ICOM (the International Council of Museums) gives a more
                    concrete (although very recently updated) definition:

                    <p>
                      A museum is a not-for-profit, permanent institution in the
                      service of society that researches, collects, conserves,
                      interprets and exhibits tangible and intangible heritage.
                      Open to the public, accessible and inclusive, museums foster
                      diversity and sustainability. They operate and communicate
                      ethically, professionally and with the participation of
                      communities, offering varied experiences for education,
                      enjoyment, reflection and knowledge sharing.

                    Both of these definitions have problems, however. It is hard
                    to imagine a museum as innocuous as San Francisco’s
                    Exploratorium as an extension of state power; at the same time
                    the Exporatorium lacks traditional collections.<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Exploratorium</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">‘Exploratorium.’ Exploratorium.

                    Despite this, it seems fairly obvious that the Exploratorium
                    is, indeed, still a museum.

                    Janet Marstine posits a more nuanced approach to the question,
                    although perhaps not a satisfying one. To Marstine, there are
                    four grand metaphors that can apply to some museums: “shrine,
                    market-driven industry, colonizing space, and post-museum.”
                    (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Marstine 2008, 8-9</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Marstine, Janet. 2008.

                        Newark: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated.</span></cite>) Shrine museums, similar to Duncan and Wallach’s definition,
                    serve as a shrine, or a space to worship something; an example
                    could be the National Museum of American History. While NMAH
                    does not give an uncritical view of this country’s past, it
                    still does serve to celebrate American history. Market-driven
                    museums, despite the somewhat condescending name, are museums
                    that seek to “‘give in’” to market demands, choosing to cater
                    to visitors instead of some lofty ideal of what a museum
                    should be. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Marstine 2008, 10</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Marstine, Janet. 2008.

                        Newark: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated.</span></cite>) Colonizing spaces, as the name suggests, are museums whose
                    collections are formed from the spoils of imperialism, using
                    the “‘other’ to construct and justify the ‘self.’” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Marstine 2008, 14</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Marstine, Janet. 2008.

                        Newark: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated.</span></cite>) The post museum is the least helpful metaphor for defining
                    museums, as it deals with the theoretical; it is a museum that
                    has transcended museums, serving less a repository for
                    knowledge and more as a way to better its community.

                  <p>
                    So, what is a museum? Well, it’s a space that, through one or
                    more of Marstine’s four metaphors, focuses on educating the
                    public about a specific topic, while often functioning as a
                    societal and social ritual. Some, like the British Museum, use
                    the excuse of public education to flaunt colonial plunder;
                    others, like the Exploratorium generally just want to teach
                    the public cool things about science. It is impossible to come
                    to a full definition, however. No matter how broad or specific
                    a definition is, there will always be spaces that fall outside
                    of it: are zoos and aquariums museums? Are libraries? There is
                    not, and will never be, a fully satisfactory definition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Defining video games is quite a bit easier: a game where
                    players use various methods of input to control and manipulate
                    moving images created by a computer program. This definition
                    is an intentionally open one: not all video games involve
                    killing enemies or chasing a high score. Some feel more like
                    pieces of art, or even entire galleries thereof. Take Asmik
                    Ace Entertainment’s <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em>, for example.
                    Directly inspired by one of the developer’s decades-spanning
                    dream journals, the game has players travel through and
                    explore incoherent, dream-like spaces.[8] After each level (if
                    they even be called that), the player is placed on a quadrant
                    chart with “downer” and “upper” as the x-axes and “static” and
                    “dynamic” as the y-axes. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Sato 1998</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Sato, Osamu, dir. 1998. <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em>.

                    <em>LSD</em> is a video game, yes, but it doesn’t really
                    behave like a game. The player is never scored; there are no
                    other characters you can interact with; there isn’t even much
                    gameplay besides walking around and observing the art. Much
                    like, say, an art gallery. Ignoring the fact that it exists
                    not as a physical structure, can
                    <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em> be considered a museum? The
                    player isn’t really taught anything, but the same could be
                    said about art museums whose labels include little more than
                    the artist, the medium, and the year painted. The deciding
                    factor, then, should be intent: are these video games or other
                    digital media projects intended to be treated like a museum?
                    For <em>LSD</em>, the answer seems to be no. It functions as
                    more an individual art piece, something to be displayed in and
                    of itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>LSD Dream Emulator</em> is by far not the only not-game
                    video game to take on the language of art and museums. In
                    November of 2021, British art-rock band Radiohead released
                    <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em>. The game is best described
                    as a visual arts museum dedicated to albums <em>Kid A</em> and
                    <em>Amnesiac</em>; each song given a room with surreal,
                    occasionally unsettling accompanying visuals. It may not exist
                    in the real world, but the intention for this to be an actual,
                    physical museum space was there from the start.

                    Thom Yorke, Radiohead’s frontman, and Stanley Donwood,
                    Radiohead’s main artist, both initially wanted Kid A Mnesia to
                    be an exhibit at the U.K.’s Victoria and Albert Museum.
                    Intending to create the space by welding together shipping
                    containers, the pair wanted it to look out of place in
                    Victoria and Albert’s classical architecture, forcing it into
                    London like an “ice pick into Trotsky.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Yorke 2021</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Yorke, Thom. 2021.

The exhibit couldn’t exist at
                    the V&amp;A without serious structural damages; the
                    Westminster council denied a change of location to the Royal
                    Albert Hall; finally, COVID-19 hit and fully denied any plans
                    of a physical exhibition space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In many ways, <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> is more video game than
                    museum. It has a pause menu and lets you “run” with the shift
                    key; the exhibit even saves your progress if you close it and
                    then reopen at a later time. But the game has a deeply vested
                    interest in recreating the visual language of museums. Its
                    rooms contain visible fire extinguishers, camera, and digital
                    stick-figure maintenance staff; the walls guide players along
                    much like at a “real” museum. It even recreates a
                    near-universal museum experience: walking into a part of an
                    exhibit with a short film and needing to wait an awkward
                    amount of time for it to restart. Except, in this case, the
                    short film is distorted footage of Thom Yorke creating a song

                    If the <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em> is a museum, then it
                    should be able to be described by one of Marstine’s four
                    metaphors. It certainly isn’t a colonizing space, nor is it a
                    market-driven industry; the game, after all, is free. It does
                    match the criteria to be a shrine, however— a shrine, more
                    specifically, to the paired albums of <em>Kid A</em> and
                    <em>Amnesiac</em>. More traditional art museums have a similar
                    lack of explanation or education about their works, simply
                    displaying each piece with its title and author, much like
                    <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> has. Despite its video game-based
                    idiosyncrasies, <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> truly does seem to
                    function as a museum.

                  <p>
                    Video games also have the potential to serve as tools of
                    learning beyond just mimicking museums. After all, games are
                    already primed to teach— it is impossible to pick up a new
                    game without, in some manner, the game teaching its players
                    new mechanics. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Anderson 2019, 178</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Anderson, Sky LaRell. “The Interactive Museum: Video

                    its world. Take, for example, <em>Dark Souls III</em>, a
                    notoriously difficult action role-playing by studio From
                    Software. Beyond being difficult, the Dark Souls series is
                    known for having lore that players need to work to learn
                    about, spawning droves of YouTube accounts dedicated to
                    learning about the games’ worlds. The similarities to
                    real-world history are easily apparent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Much of the lore in <em>Dark Souls III</em> comes from the
                    descriptions of various in-game items. As these descriptions
                    are some of the only ways of learning the history of the
                    game’s world, dedicated players spend great amounts of time
                    delving into the descriptions. Valorheart, a combination sword
                    and shield, is no exception, as its description sheds light on
                    some minor aspects of the game’s world:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Weapon once wielded by the Champion of the Undead Match. A
                    special paired set consisting of a broad sword and a lion
                    shield.<br />
                    The champion fought on, without rest, until he lost his mind.
                    In the end, only his page and a lone wolf stayed at his side.
                    (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Miyazaki 2016</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Miyazaki, Hidetaki, dir. 2016. <em>Dark Souls III</em>.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Much can be gleaned from just this short description. First,
                    whatever society this Champion belonged to used to value
                    gladiatorial combat between various undead people and was
                    structured enough to have pages— that is, knights’ assistants.
                    Additionally, it may have viewed the lion as an important
                    symbol, given its presence on Valorheart’s shield.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it of course has its differences, this process is not
                    dissimilar to real life history. Players and historians both
                    have to make inferences about past societies using only what
                    these cultures left behind, whether it be real, written
                    accounts or fictional item descriptions.
                    <em>Dark Souls III</em> is by no means an educational title,
                    but it shows how games can be used to teach. This goes beyond
                    just self-identified educational games, as those “tend to be
                    boring, monotonous, and frankly not very well-designed
                    visually, mechanically, or even pedagogically.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Anderson 2019, 191</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Anderson, Sky LaRell. “The Interactive Museum: Video

                    for potentially hours, something which traditional methods of
                    education rarely are able to do.

                  <p>
                    Games cannot, of course, outright replace traditional methods
                    of education like classes or textbooks. Instead, they can
                    function as methods of “tangential learning,” in which the
                    education takes place in the background, almost unnoticed,
                    while the main focus for the player is the game itself.

                    In their individual ways, <em>LSD: Dream Emulator</em>,
                    <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em>, and
                    <em>Dark Souls III</em> each showcase the benefits— and
                    potential pitfalls— of video games as museums. <em>LSD</em> is
                    perhaps the least museum-esque of the three, but it serves as
                    an example of video games as art. Like some museums that lack
                    interpretative labels, the game leaves its players (or perhaps
                    viewers) to interpret the art for themselves, allowing them to
                    each make their own distinct interpretations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> most directly represents the visual
                    design and visual language of museums. Radiohead was very
                    interested in recreating the experience of going to a museum,
                    while making use of the unique properties of video games to
                    create an experience more abstract than would be possible with
                    a real, brick-and-mortar museum. It also has the benefit of
                    being much more accessible than physical museums; while it
                    does require that players have a powerful enough computer to
                    run the program and have a general knowledge of how to play
                    first-person video games, anyone regardless of physical
                    location is able to play the game. There are also fewer
                    (although not zero) barriers with those with physical
                    disabilities, as there are no possibilities of inaccessible
                    bathrooms or lack of wheelchair-friendly ramps, for example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> does not teach its players
                    anything, at least not directly. Most art museums, at least
                    American ones, have some interpretation. Labels explain the
                    artist’s history or inspirations; text on the walls explains
                    the overarching theme of an exhibit; docents answer visitors’
                    questions. The closest <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> comes to this is
                    the very beginning of the game, where some text on a wall
                    begins with modified lyrics from the band’s song “Pulk/Pull
                    Revolving Doors” followed by this somewhat cryptic poem:
                  </p>

                    <figcaption class="q-figure__caption" data-outputs-include="epub,pdf">

                    </figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  <p>
                    This begs the question: do museums need to be educational? Or
                    is the presentation of art in an interesting manner enough?
                    While Kid A Mnesia may at times look like a museum, calling
                    itself an exhibition and providing a museum-esque map at a
                    linked website, it often does not function like one. It
                    intentionally dehumanizes every other person in the space,
                    other “guests” and museum employees alike being rendered as
                    simple stick figures. Instead, the game uses the design space
                    of museums as background context to show the players its art
                    and its music, less interested in pedagogy and more interested
                    in evoking specific feelings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On top of all of that, Kid A Mnesia does not make use of video
                    games’ specific strengths as a medium; it uses its unreal
                    location to be able to create impossible geometry and layouts,
                    yes, but beyond that the experience is akin to that of going
                    to a physical museum. While that was probably intentional,
                    given the project’s initial roots as a real exhibit, video
                    games are capable of providing learning experiences in manners
                    wildly different from actual museums.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike <em>LSD Dream Emulator</em>, which functions more like
                    a piece of art than a game, and <em>Kid A Mnesia</em>, with
                    its interest in the visual language of museums,
                    <em>Dark Souls III</em> does not in any way try to mimic or
                    recreate real-world art or museums. Despite this, it still
                    manages to teach its players about its fictional setting in a
                    manner potentially more effective and engaging than
                    traditional classroom environments. What if, then, instead of
                    video games mimicking museums, museums mimicked video games?
                    In further exploration of this question, Seb Chan discusses
                    <em>Sleep No More</em>, an immersive theater experience
                    “loosely based on Macbeth [and] inspired by film noir.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Chan 2012</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Chan, Seb. 2012. “On Sleep No More, Magic and Immersive

                    wander the stage, gaining a highly unique and individualized
                    experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Museums have always been wary of overly theatrical
                    experiences, lest they be labeled as “charlatans.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Chan 2012</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Chan, Seb. 2012. “On Sleep No More, Magic and Immersive

                        23, 2012.</span></cite>) But that attitude betrays museums’ nineteenth century
                    popular roots— roots of cabinets of curiosities and freak
                    shows (despite the unsavory nature of the name) advertising
                    wonders like “‘miracles of modern medicine…’ [and] freak
                    shows.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Chan 2012</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Chan, Seb. 2012. “On Sleep No More, Magic and Immersive

                    experiences like Sleep No More or video games writ large.<br />
                    To break the veil of academic professionalism, some of my
                    recent favorite museum experiences have come from heavily
                    interactive exhibits. Planet Word, a linguistics-focused
                    museum in Washington, D.C., has several very interactive
                    experiences. (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Planet Word</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">‘Planet Word.’ Planet Word Museum. Accessed November
                        23rd, 2023.
                        <a href="https://planetwordmuseum.org/" target="_blank">https://planetwordmuseum.org/</a></span></cite>) These range from a collaborative lesson with a computer
                    about English etymology to helping an artificial intelligence
                    workshop its jokes. While not on the same level of
                    interactivity as <em>Sleep No More</em>, Planet Word’s
                    exhibits show how much more engaging non-linear, personalized
                    experiences can be. As a college linguistics major, I hardly
                    learned anything at Planet Word, but I nevertheless found it
                    all incredibly fun. Working with a group of fellow guests
                    trying to guess the language of origin of “shampoo” (Hindi)
                    was a more memorable experience than simply reading some text
                    on a wall discussing the origins of the word.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the world continues to further digitize, museums need to
                    digitize with it. Although I will always love museums, ranging
                    from the imposing federally funded affairs to the hyper-local,
                    low budget exhibits, they can be intimidating and difficult to
                    break into. I am not suggesting that museum docents should
                    lead guests to a video game console and have that be the
                    majority of the visit, but the inherent accessibility and
                    individuality of game-like experiences should be considered.
                    This could even be a step towards Marstine’s idealized “post
                    museum,” a community-focused endeavor that aims not to simply
                    collect and study but to engage with its visitors and local
                    community on a more personal level.
